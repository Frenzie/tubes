<p>As long-time visitors know I occasionally talk about Dutch politics here for the benefit
of my Dutch readers as well as those twelve foreign readers that are interested in these matters.
Since Dutch government fell late yesterday night, it&#8217;s time for another such post.</p>

<p>The Balkenende IV government (i.e. the fourth government that Balkenende (CDA) was prime
minister of) was formed three years ago and consists of centre-right
CDA (christian-democrats), centre-left PvdA (Labour), and orthodox-protestant left-leaning

and the PvdA was slated to lose a lot of seats everywhere. PvdA party leader and finance
minister Bos clearly hopes to stem the electoral tide by his resignation, and he might well
be right.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: This will be the last political entry on the main QuirksBlog. I now have a separate <a href="/politics">politics section</a> with a blog as well as an article series about Dutch political history.</p>

<p>In any case I approve of Bos&#8217;s actions both from a policy and from a politics point
of view. (Some Dutch readers will certainly disagree, and as long as they stay polite I don&#8217;t
mind them commenting. These matters aren&#8217;t simple.)</p>

<h3>Policy</h3>

<p>The question was whether the Dutch military presence in the Uruzgan province of Afghanistan,
originally planned to end by the end of this year, was to be extended for another period of
time. The PvdA said No to this, while CDA and CU tended towards Yes.</p>

<h4>Uruzgan</h4>

<p>At the end of 2007 the Balkenende IV government decided to extend Dutch presence in Uruzgan
for another two years, but commented that the final withdrawal would start in the second half
of 2010. This withdrawal decision was repeated by parliament in a 2009 motion, with most of
the opposition as well as PvdA and CU supporting the motion. Since then it has been clear that,
although the CU might be convinced of staying in Afghanistan, the PvdA was against, and this
standpoint clearly mirrored its electorate&#8217;s feelings.</p>

<p>What happened in the past few weeks is not entirely clear; in fact, PvdA party leader and
finance minister Bos openly disagreed about the details with foreign minister and presumed future CDA party leader
Verhagen in parliament. In Dutch constitutional law such sniping between fellow ministers
is Not Done; government should form a coherent unity when it talks to parliament. This was
definitely not the case in the last few days.</p>

<p>What is certain is that the NATO officially requested Dutch government to extend its mission
in Afghanistan, a request that foreign minister Verhagen is now required to decline. I know
little of NATO procedure, but it seems that declining such a request is Not Done. On the other
hand, the NATO only makes such a request if it&#8217;s certain beforehand that the government
in question will in fact accept it. Something has clearly gone wrong here.</p>

<p>The theory that was aired yesterday evening is that Verhagen had overstepped his mandate
by informing the NATO that the Dutch would extend their presence while this matter hadn&#8217;t
yet been decided on by government. Whether all this is true is
uncertain, but from a politics standpoint this theory works in favour of the PvdA, as we&#8217;ll
see in a moment.</p>

<p>Yesterday&#8217;s meeting of the council of ministers was slated to be the last one before
the local elections (all ministers will be on the campaign trail next week), and the PvdA had
demanded earlier that government rule out a continuing stay in Uruzgan at the present level, although
alternatives, such as training local Afghan forces and helping with the development could still
be discussed.</p>

<p>It seems that CDA and CU refused to rule out an extension of the Uruzgan mission. After a
fourteen-hour marathon meeting the PvdA ministers decided to resign over this. They stated that
their point of view was well known beforehand, and that parliament would never approve of an
extended mission since the PvdA fraction would vote against it, together with most of the
opposition.</p>

<p>And indeed, the PvdA&#8217;s point of view is no surprise to anyone who follows politics.
What <em>is</em> surprising is that the PvdA didn&#8217;t cave in to the exigencies of power
(as well as the CDA); a scenario that I, in any case, considered most likely until yesterday.
The PvdA has rediscovered the backbone that went missing somewhere in the late eighties.</p>

<h4>The international angle</h4>

<p>Critics of the PvdA&#8217;s move point out that the country is making itself ridiculous
in the international arena. Although they have a point of sorts, what surprised me most in
yesterday evening&#8217;s coverage was that every single Dutch foreign policy &#8220;expert&#8221;
was content to just repeat the US point of view without even thinking about it and without wondering
what the Dutch and European interest in this whole affair is. They repeatedly conjured up
Obama, who is kind of the iPhone of current politics, but did not make clear why we should
unthinkingly support the US even when its policies make no sense.</p>

<p>Sure, the US will be disappointed because it&#8217;ll have to find another country willing
to take over the Uruzgan province. Still, I feel that this is beside the point. The US strategy
of occupying Afghanistan while chasing the pipe dream of making it a democratic country that
will somehow magically transform itself into a reliable Western ally and a denouncer of everything
Taliban is just wrong. Obama is just wrong with his troop surge; it does not serve any vital
Western interest but is instead aimed at pacifying the proto-fascist wing of the Republican
party that is beyond pacifying anyway.</p>

<p>As to the Al-Qaida training camps, what&#8217;s keeping Al-Qaida from moving them to another
country? Sudan or Somalia or something? (In fact, they&#8217;ve likely already done so.)
Occupying Afghanistan does not solve this problem at all.</p>

<p>Thus continuing presence in Afghanistan does not serve any Dutch or European
interest, only a US domestic politics one. Besides, this policy will fail both in Afghanistan
and in the US. So why not end our involvement now?</p>

<p>True, the now-crippled Dutch government, as well as its post-election successor, will catch
some international flak. Still, the most likely net result of all this is that the Dutch prime
minister will not be invited to have tea at the White House any time soon. That&#8217;s something
we might conceivably survive as a country.</p>

<h3>Politics</h3>

<p>The politics of this move are considerably more complicated, and it&#8217;s in these politics
that we discover the true reasons for the PvdA to resign.</p>

<h4>A flawed government</h4>

<p>The Balkenende IV government was flawed from the start. During the 2006 election campaign
party leaders Balkenende (CDA) and Bos (PvdA) repeatedly clashed, and Balkenende succesfully
painted Bos as a turncoat who time and again reneged on his promises.</p>

<p>The peculiarities of the Dutch political system forced both party leaders to cooperate after
the elections, though, and they formed a government with an insincere smile plastered on their
faces.</p>

<p>Argument followed protracted argument, and in the last year or so it became clear that it
wasn&#8217;t a question of whether this government would fall, but when.</p>

<p>All this infighting has a long, long, history which you might one day read in my Dutch politics
primer for foreigners. Suffice it to say that PvdA and CDA are long-time rivals, and that usually
the CDA holds the upper hand because it has an alternative coalition partner in right-wing VVD,
while the PvdA does not have such an alternative.</p>

<p>The PvdA wants revenge, and I tend to sympathise with that. The christian-democrats, especially
the catholic ones, can be very, very slick and unpleasant to work with. The current state of affairs
temporarily gives the PvdA the upper hand, and party leader Bos decided to use this leverage to
the hilt. Good for him.</p>

<h4>Electoral reasons</h4>

<p>Thus, from a broad perspective the fall of government does not come as a surprise. Still, why now,
and not earlier or later?</p>

<p>One reason is the upcoming local elections, which the PvdA was expected to lose dramatically.
However, the national party leader keeping his back straight and not turncoating in the face of
a christian-democratic onslaught might very well help the local party chapters.</p>

<p>Even better, the PvdA has made the difference between itself and the CDA very clear on a
non-economic issue. The CDA has always succesfully painted the PvdA as the party of big spending
(the reason Bos became finance minister is exactly to counter that story).</p>

<p>Therefore, breaking
with government on a social-economic issue such as pensions or wages would be a political
toss-up in the best case; a disaster for the PvdA in even a slightly worse scenario. Breaking
on a non-economic, yet clearly important, issue is a much better idea.</p>

<p>Right now polls show that two thirds of Dutch favour leaving Afghanistan, with 45% feeling
that this issue is worth a cabinet crisis (with 35% feeling it isn&#8217;t and the rest unsure).</p>

<p>The PvdA represents the voters better than the CDA right now. That&#8217;s unusual, and Bos
is right in making use of that fact.</p>

<h4>CDA in disarray</h4>

<p>Besides, right now it seems that the CDA is in disarray and
is decidedly less well prepared for general elections than the PvdA.</p>

<p>Although he has shown ample amounts of tenacity, prime minister and CDA party leader Balkenende
has never truly convinced as a leader. All of his governments fell before their time, again and
again he was unable to keep his ministers in check and provide overall direction to both party
and country.</p>

<p>It might be time for the CDA to find a new leader. Now internal CDA fights are notoriously
difficult to follow, and nobody knows exactly what&#8217;s going on, but one thing is clear:
because Balkenende is a protestant, the next CDA party leader must be a catholic. And the highest
catholic within the CDA is foreign minister Verhagen.</p>

<p>From this point of view, PvdA party leader Bos arguing with Verhagen instead of Balkenende makes
a lot of sense. Bos tries to cripple the next CDA party leader before he&#8217;s even formally
succeeded Balkenende.</p>

<p>It is very clear that a final decision on the transfer of leadership has not yet been taken.
Such deliberations always take lots of time, especially with the christian-democrats who set
store on proper, slow procedure that gives everybody and their dog a chance to say their say,
although the final decision will rest with the party leadership.</p>

<p>Still, the CDA is now forced to choose between Balkenende and Verhagen quickly. Balkenende
has about reached his Best-Before date, and besides he&#8217;s just lost his third cabinet from
an internal argument that could have been prevented, and he&#8217;s definitely on the defensive
against the PvdA right now.</p>

<p>However, a quick transfer of power to Verhagen might be even more problematic. First of all
such transfers take time, time the CDA might not have with general elections looming near.</p>

<p>Secondly, it seems that the PvdA has tarred Verhagen very efficiently. Verhagen can easily
be painted as yet one more insincere, sleek, slick, untrustworthy catholic politician; and this prototype
has considerable power in Dutch politics. Non-catholic voters (even protestants who might
otherwise vote CDA) are influenced by it. A CDA led by catholic Verhagen might be in for a rougher ride
than one led by protestant Balkenende.</p>

<p>Thirdly, there&#8217;s orthodox-protestant CU. Of the three
government parties it is the only one that has consistently shown a slight but definite gain
in the polls, while both PvdA and CDA slid down. The question is whether left-leaning protestant
CDA voters will leave their own party and vote CU instead. This is a disaster scenario for the
CDA: the CU is the only party that can reach the CDA&#8217;s soft underbelly of Bible-inspired
voters that the secular parties of left and right cannot touch.</p>

<p>Point is that the most efficient stop-gap against the CU is Balkenende, because he&#8217;s
as protestant as CU leader Rouvoet is. If, however, a catholic were to succeed to the CDA
party leadership, this might be the last straw for some protestant voters, and the CU might
hugely profit.</p>

<p>Thus, although Balkenende is untenable, Verhagen is even more untenable. The only solution
would be to elect a new protestant as party leader (there are several good candidates), but this
will upset the catholic voters and party members as well as breaking a Sacred Rule.</p>

<p>The CDA faces a very tough choice. Even worse, it will have to decide very quickly, and if
there&#8217;s one thing christian-democrats are bad at it&#8217;s deciding something quickly.
On balance, it&#8217;s likely that Balkenende will stay. This is not a good choice, though, just
the least bad one.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: The CDA party leadership has reelected Balkenende party leader with surprising speed. Apparently they feel the heat, too. But the CDA has now opted for the least bad choice.</p>

<p>Compare this to the PvdA, where it is clear Bos will again lead the party into the elective
struggle crowned by the aura of this break in government. Besides, the PvdA
seems to represent the will of the voters better than the CDA right now,
its base has been galvanised by the totally unexpected show of backbone, and it is clearly
unified and ready for battle.</p>

<p><em>Very</em> nicely played, mr. Bos. My hat is off to you.</p>

<h3>What&#8217;s next?</h3>

<p>Prime minister Balkenende will report to the Queen, who will ask him to form a
temporary caretaker government (Balkenende V) consisting of CDA and CU. General elections
are expected in late May or early June.</p>

<h4>Elections</h4>

<p>So what will happen in the elections? First of all, a caution against polls.</p>

<p>Right now the polls say that the PVV of anti-Islamic mouth-frothingly angry extreme-right
Geert Wilders will become the first or second party of the country. I do not believe this will happen.</p>

<p>When elections are still far off Dutch voters tend to vote with their underbelly. Many people
will tell the pollster they&#8217;ll vote Wilders just because they&#8217;re angry at government,
politics, and the world at large. When actual elections come close, however, many of them will
reconsider and in the end decide to vote for a more moderate party. Thus I expect Wilders to
gain a few seats, but not too many. I&#8217;d say he goes up from his current 9 (out of 150)
to about 12 to 15. But that&#8217;s about it.</p>

<p>How CDA and CU will do is unpredictable right now; we first have to see how the leadership
fight in the CDA turns out. I expect the CU to remain at or near its current 6-seat level when
a protestant is in charge of the CDA, and to grow somewhat (9?) when a catholic takes over.
As to the CDA, it will certainly fall somewhat from its current 41 seats.</p>

<p>The PvdA will do much better than in the current polls. Right now the social-democrats have
33 seats, and the polls expect them to drop to 15 to 18. It&#8217;s virtually certain that
Bos&#8217;s resignation will help the PvdA considerably, and will prevent seats seeping away
to its three competitors on the left flank of Dutch politics. Maybe it will stay close to
its current 33 seats; let&#8217;s call it 30 to 35.</p>

<p>Moderate right-wing VVD will win some seats and go up from their current 21 to about
28 or so. The VVD always wins after a spell in the opposition, and although it has not provided
much inspired guidance, it&#8217;s available on the right while being neither CDA nor Wilders.
That&#8217;s probably a recipe for electoral gains right now.</p>

<h4>New government</h4>

<p>The Balkenende IV government consisted of the largest parties of the left and right, and it
was a miserable failure. It seems likely that the next government will have a more clear right-
or left-wing signature; especially since the big policy question will be what to do about the
crisis. Do we want a left-wing or a right-wing solution?</p>

<p>Now historically the right is slightly bigger than the left in Dutch politics. A left-wing
government, which would have to consist of at least four parties, is possible in theory, but not
very likely. At least, that would be the situation in most elections. However, this year
there&#8217;s a problem on the right.</p>

<p>The combined parties of the right might very well obtain a majority in parliament, but the
point is that <em>this includes Wilders</em>. In order to form a right-wing government, Wilders
is indispensable.</p>

<p>Now this opens up perspectives for the parties on the left. If their message were to
be &#8220;Vote CDA or VVD, and get Wilders for free&#8221; they might actually give some
voters who feel at home on the right wing but despise Wilders pause. More specifically, it
will give the (smallish) evangelical left wing of the CDA an additional reason to vote CU instead. Who knows, it might even cause some VVD voters to veer leftward to D66.</p>

<p>Thus these elections are likely to become interesting.</p>

<h4>Dutch politics primer</h4>

<p>For me personally the elections also mean a tough choice. From the previous 2006 elections on
I have steadily worked on a Dutch political primer for foreigners. My plan was to publish it
just before the next elections, which were originally planned for May 2011. However, the current
crisis has moved that date down by a year, and I&#8217;m not ready yet.</p>

<p>Currently I&#8217;m not sure what to do, mostly because I don&#8217;t have a lot of time
I can spend on the political primer before the elections. Three out of eleven articles remain
unwritten, and the other eight still need a stiff edit. I also wanted to move some of the
JavaScript-generated maps to SVG, but it seems unlikely that that&#8217;s going to happen
any time soon. Content first.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll see. I first need to know the election date, which will probably be announced
in the next week or so.</p>

<p>MWC is huge, and by that I don&#8217;t mean SxSW-style huge. You could drop all of SxSW smack-bang
in the middle of MWC, and nobody would notice (apart from the people in the drop area).
With only 50,000 delegates this was a decidedly bad year, as one Vodafone MWC veteran pointed out to me.</p>

<p>All major and a lot of minor mobile players were there, with the exception of Apple
and (curiously) Nokia. Apple&#8217;s absence was expected; it follows its own unique trajectory
and basically ignores the rest of the industry when it comes to announcements. (Apple might have
a point here; it gets more attention for its announcements when they&#8217;re done entirely
outside the MWC timeframe.)</p>

<p>Nokia&#8217;s absence
created a huge buzz; it was the main MWC sponsor for many years before it suddenly withdrew
this year. Unfortunately I&#8217;m not yet well enough versed in mobile political sciences
to be able to explain this. (And don&#8217;t leave a &#8220;simple&#8221; explanation in
the comments! This stuff isn&#8217;t simple!)</p>

<p>Phone-wise I was deep, deep inside BlackBerry land, as you&#8217;d expect with business executives
and marketing people. There were few iPhones, I saw almost no Androids,
though Samsung had a surprisingly solid presence.</p>

<p>Anyway, the main general question right now is when browsers will become a hot topic
on MWC. This year they weren&#8217;t; the 30-minute panel for about 100 attendees I participated
in was about the most browser-focused event of the entire conference. Still, I believe that browser
quality is an emerging theme in mobile, so I expect a future MWC (next year? year after? 2013?) to
be more browser-aware.</p>

<p>This will be something to watch; if even business executives start to seriously
consider browsers, web technologies will have basically annexed the mobile space. That
would be a cool extension to our current reach, right?</p>

<p>For those following the smartphone market Tomi Ahonen&#8217;s
<a href="http://communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/2010/02/dispatches-from-the-front-line-war-reporter-checks-in-from-smartphone-wars-of-2010.html"
class="external">smartphone war frontline update</a> is required reading. He currently
expects Apple to be in serious trouble because Christmas sales were bad. It will be
interesting to follow that storyline as it unfolds.</p>

<h3>Announcements</h3>

<p>Everybody and their dog considers MWC the prime venue to make exciting announcements. As a result
you hear all announcements at once, and few make more than a fleeting impression.</p>

<p>Besides, MWC is not a technical conference. It&#8217;s a business and marketing conference
where business and marketing people try to impress other business and marketing people by
firing off a stream of tech-based buzzwords.</p>

<p>Neither
the broadcasting nor the receiving party have the slightest clue what they&#8217;re talking about,
and it&#8217;s this curious mechanism that gives
all MWC-related press releases the unique vagueness that make them so hard to interpret by techies.</p>

<p>Nonetheless I&#8217;ve
carefully gathered most (all? nah, probably not) announcements that are important to web developers. Here&#8217;s the
list, in the approximate order in which they made a splash in web dev land.</p>

<h4>Microsoft</h4>

<p>Microsoft announced its new Windows Phone line which runs Windows Mobile 7, and a new version
of IE that I currently expect to be based on IE8. I saw from my Twitter feed that this announcement
was well-received. Unfortunately the Microsoft stand turned out to have no actual Windows Phones
in it, so I couldn&#8217;t test anything and will reserve judgement until I&#8217;ve actually used
one.</p>

<p>More in general, this is Microsoft&#8217;s last chance to matter on mobile, and they know it.
Windows Mobile 6.1 is just spectacularly bad. Windows Mobile 6.5 is a lot better, but still no
real competitor to iPhone, Android, or Symbian. Will Windows Mobile 7 help here? Only time will
tell.</p>

<p>Obviously I&#8217;ll post a full test report as soon as I can get my hands on a device.</p>

<h4>Opera</h4>

<p>Opera was canny enough to send out its exciting announcement slightly ahead of the crowd.
It will shortly submit Opera Mini to the Apple App Store. Although at first I doubted the
technical wisdom of this move (Safari iPhone is far ahead of Opera Mini, which, after all,
does not offer any client-side interactivity), I&#8217;m now starting to revise my opinion.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#8217;d welcome Opera Mini because my Safari iPhone has taken up the nasty
habit of crashing on my <a href="https://webmail.xs4all.nl/plugins/xs4all_login/xs4all_login.php"
class="external">webmail</a> site. The more I reload it (and have to re-login), the higher
this crash chance is.</p>

<p>More in general, Opera Mini uses far less bandwidth than Safari iPhone because it sends
a highly compressed version of the site to the phone. Right now that might matter on lousy
connections (such as the ones in Barcelona, where 50,000 mobile professionals clogged the
networks considerably). In the future, though, it will start to matter even more because eventually the
operators will put an end to the economically untenable flat-rate iPhone data plan. When that
happens Opera Mini will become an interesting alternative because it saves you money.</p>

<p>Still, the main point of this release is political. By publicly announcing their intent, Opera has put Apple
in the position of either allowing the first competing browser on the iPhone or being slammed
for not allowing it. (Currently all alternative iPhone browsers use the Safari rendering engine;
Opera Mini would be the first to use a different one.)</p>

<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how this one plays out.</p>

<h4>WAC and network APIs</h4>

<p>Then, no less than 24 global operators announced the <a href="http://www.wholesaleappcommunity.com/"
class="external">Wholesale Applications Community</a> which aims at spreading applications
to an installed base of not 100 million iPhone users, but 3 billion users of other phones.</p>

<p>This is typically something operator executives love; it&#8217;s an &#8220;answer&#8221;
to the App Store (which, in my opinion, doesn&#8217;t need an answer because it&#8217;s
slowly going to be transformed into a niche market mostly for games and other applications
that need to be native, and not web-based. But I digress.)</p>

<p>Obviously, the announcement gave no technical details whatsoever. This is a business
and marketing thing, after all.</p>

<p>Still, to anyone who spends more than half a second thought on it it should be clear
that there&#8217;s only one single technology that gives the operators a fighting chance
of attaining their objective: web technologies.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the fact that web standards are the obvious answer does not mean that they
will actually play a role in the WAC initiative. Ignoring the obvious is something that
executives are very good at.</p>

<p>Still, Vodafone is part of the consortium, and Vodafone is investing heavily in web
standards (even to the extent of paying me to do fundamental research). So I
guess we can hope. As far as I know the Vodafone widget-based system is currently the <em>only</em>
one that works on more than one platform.</p>

<p>Related to this is the news that operators are working on &#8220;network APIs.&#8221;
I&#8217;m not yet totally sure what they are (technical info, as usual, is completely
absent), but it <a href="http://www.betavine.net/bvportal/resources/api/vodafonenetwork"
class="external">seems likely</a> that they&#8217;ll include APIs for mobile payments.</p>

<p>The point here is that operator-based payments are the most user-friendly ones possible
because, contrary to every single current app store, you <em>do not need to log in</em>.
Your identity is ascertained through your SIM card, and the payment is added to your
operator bill. Mobile payments cannot be made any simpler than that. (Besides, the operators
obviously love this middle-man position.)</p>

<h4>BlackBerry WebKit</h4>

<p>Then BlackBerry announced that a new WebKit-based browser is coming up. This is no
surprise to anyone following the mobile industry. About six months back BlackBerry
acquired Torch Mobile, the creator of the Iris browser. Since the Iris browser scored
rather well in my <a href="/webkit.html">tests</a>, it was obvious that BlackBerry wanted
a high-quality replacement for their proprietary browser whose Best-Before date was reached
somewhere in 2008.</p>

<p>As far as I know there were no actual devices with the new browser in Barcelona (but
by the time this news reached me I had become very tired, and I didn&#8217;t try very hard
to find them).</p>

<p>Still, the 100/100 Acid 3 score gives us a clue as to what&#8217;s going on. I
<a href="/webkit.html">found</a> only four WebKit-based browsers with this score: Safari
desktop and iPhone, Chrome, and Iris. (Android 2 not yet tested; wouldn&#8217;t be surprised
if it scored 100/100, too.)</p>

<p>I assume that the Torch Mobile team has been working on an actual port of the Iris browser to
the BlackBerry OS instead of creating a wholly new one. This would bode well for the
mobile web.</p>

<p>But remember: <a href="/blog/archives/2009/10/there_is_no_web.html">THERE IS NO WEBKIT
ON MOBILE!</a> This is no iPhone WebKit magically transmuted into a BlackBerry
application, it&#8217;s a completely separate WebKit implementation. A good one, most
likely, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s the same as the iPhone.</p>

<p>Ignore any post you read about the new BlackBerry browser somehow making
the creation iPhone-only sites more acceptable. That&#8217;s just uninformed nonsense. However,
using BlackBerry WebKit as an additional argument for serious use of progressive
enhancement, as <a href="http://forabeautifulweb.com/blog/about/do_try_this_at_work/"
class="external">Andy proposes</a>, is an excellent strategic idea that&#8217;s worth a try.</p>

<p>Obviously I&#8217;ll post a full test report as soon as I can get my hands on a device.</p>

<h4>Adobe</h4>

<p>The Adobe stand was all about Flash, and sported the tagline &#8220;One Web, any device.&#8221;
Although I agree with the basic sentiment, I&#8217;m not sure if Flash is going to
deliver on that promise. I&#8217;d like a list of mobile platforms on which it is supported,
but obviously the Adobe site doesn&#8217;t give any clue of that. (Nobody ever does that ever;
everybody&#8217;s very vague about platforms and just assures anyone who&#8217;s willing to listen that
<em>their</em> mobile solution works practically everywhere. But I digress.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/devices/mobile_flash_10-1_developers.html"
class="external">This list</a> of mobile Flash videos is the closest I came, and it
mentions Android and Palm, but no other platforms. Not exactly a huge user base.</p>

<p>The odd thing is that Adobe&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.distimo.com/2010_02_adobes-platform-to-deliver-apps-across-all-phones/"
class="external">announcement</a> was not about Flash but about AIR. This, apparently, will
be the technology to deliver content across all platforms &#8212; well, to Android and BlackBerry, at
least.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll see. The pro of AIR (or Flash) would be that it is the single RIA environment
(except for plain old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) that works on more than one platform. The
con is that it doesn&#8217;t work on <em>that</em> many platforms.</p>

<p>Adobe AIR uses WebKit, by the way. I never tested it, but it&#8217;s safe to assume that
it&#8217;s different from all other WebKits.</p>

<h4>Samsung bada</h4>

<p>One of my personal top stories was the unveiling of Samsung bada (Korean for ocean;
not capitalised), the new smartphone OS that runs a spiffing new WebKit implementation
that&#8217;s different from all other WebKit implementations.</p>

<p>I give kudos to Samsung for actually allowing anyone to play with their new Wave phone
in their stand. I took the opportunity to invent guerilla browser testing; I fired
up the browser and did some very quick tests while standing in the Samsung stand. I returned
twice when I&#8217;d thought of more tests to do. I crashed two phones in the
process.</p>

<p>The WebKit-based browser seems to be called Dolfin; in line with the ocean metaphor that Samsung
has chosen. It is not to be confused with the Dolphin browser for Android &#8212; I think.</p>

<p>The bad news is that Dolfin is not yet very good. The good news
is that Samsung clearly stressed that the software wasn&#8217;t yet final; changes would
be made. I hope they change a lot on the browser side of things.</p>

<p>I was able to prove that Dolfin is closely related to the widget manager WebKit
on the H1/M1 Vodafone devices; something I&#8217;d more or less expected. There&#8217;s
one bug in my still-unpublished width research that occurs only on the Samsung bada and widget manager
WebKits, and nowhere else. (There is no &#8220;WebKit on Mobile!&#8221; They&#8217;re all
different!)</p>

<p>As a whole bada seems a reasonably good platform. The point here is that it&#8217;s not
meant as a high-end smartphone platform that competes with iPhone, Android, or Maemo, but
instead a mid-range one that will compete with Symbian. Some quality has been sacrificed on
the altar of affordability.</p>

<h4>Bolt and widgets</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://boltbrowser.com/home.html" class="external">Bolt browser</a>,
which is the main competitor to Opera Mini, now supports W3C Widgets in version 1.7.
Bolt is WebKit-based, by the way, but it&#8217;s different from all other WebKits.</p>

<p>This news is interesting because it requires Bolt to use a different architecture than the standard
widgets W3C is defining and Vodafone and Opera are implementing. Such a widget is
an application stored on the device that uses a full browser that offers
full JavaScript capabilities to run in.</p>

<p>Like Opera Mini, Bolt does
not support client-side interaction, but instead requires a full page refresh every time
a script changes something to the DOM. Besides, the widgets cannot be stored on the device
because there&#8217;s no full browser there, just a thin client that gets its instructions
from the server. Therefore the widgets will be stored server-side. The downside of this
is that you need something like a Bolt account to access your widgets. (Details aren&#8217;t
clear to me.)</p>

<h4>Android</h4>

<p>Google&#8217;s announcement was that 60,000 Android phones are sold per day. Let&#8217;s
be clear: this encompasses all Android phones, whether they&#8217;re branded by Google
itself, HTC, Samsung, Motorola, SonyEricsson, or minor players. Still, it&#8217;s an
impressive number that might upgrade Android to third-largest smartphone operating system in 2010,
after Symbian and BlackBerry, but before the iPhone.</p>

<p>Still, all&#8217;s not well in the Android world. The problem is the Nexus One.
Google&#8217;s release of its own branded phone (created by HTC) has widely been interpreted
as a stab in the back of Motorola, who&#8217;s gambled its existence as a smartphone
vendor (or even as a device vendor in general) on the Droid-centred Android strategy.
The Google phone is obviously a serious competitor to the Droid in the eyes of the
affluent tech-savvy US smartphone purchaser. (Motorola is irrelevant outside the US.)</p>

<p>To partly make up for that HTC unveiled the Desire, an HTC-branded and -skinned phone
that runs on exactly the same hardware as the Nexus One. HTC&#8217;s brand awareness
doesn&#8217;t come close to Google&#8217;s, but still it has a decent market share in
Asia and Europe, and of the generic vendors without their own OS I definitely rank HTC
first when it comes to interface design and general performance. They even made Windows
Mobile 6.1 work &#8212; more or less.</p>

<p>Right now I don&#8217;t know how much all this matters. Some people will buy an Android
phone specifically; others buy a SonyEricsson, HTC, or Motorola phone without knowing
anything about the OS. Motorola will likely fall out of the race in 2010, and it could
full well blame Google, but it&#8217;s certain that Google won&#8217;t care.
Meanwhile it&#8217;s unclear whether Google cares about the HTC Desire.</p>

<p>In any case, of the sub-markets the Android one will remain by far the most complicated
because there are so many players involved. Every single Android player, however, has
at least one alternative platform in case of emergency. Except for Google.</p>

<p>Android will be one of the major unfolding stories of the year.</p>

<h4>Nokia and MeeGo</h4>

<p>As to Nokia, despite being absent from MWC it had one announcement for each of its
smartphone platforms. Symbian^3, the successor to S60, is coming this year. No more
details are known, but I expect its WebKit to be significantly upgraded. (It still will
be <em>different from all other WebKits</em>, though.)</p>

<p>More interesting is the Maemo news, because industry pundits generally expect Maemo
to become Nokia&#8217;s high-end smartphone platform, while Symbian will serve the
low end and the business market.</p>

<p>Point is, Maemo&#8217;s gone. It has been merged with Intel&#8217;s Moblin platform
to produce MeeGo (silly name in my opinion, but nobody asked me). I have no clue what
this means in terms of browsers (technical details, obviously, are absent). And no,
I have no idea what Intel was doing in the mobile OS world, either. Maybe this merger
was the point. (Whose chipsets will the new MeeGo devices use?)</p>

<p>For now I assume that the Gecko-based MicroB browser will remain the default one
of the new system, and that Mozilla will create a Firefox port for it. That&#8217;s just
guesswork, though.</p>

<p>The most interesting tidbit is that the new MeeGo platform is not restricted to
Nokia; <a href="http://www.liliputing.com/2010/02/lg-gw990-smartphone-to-run-meego-linux.html"
class="external">LG just announced</a> it will release a MeeGo phone. It was already
working with Moblin, anyway, so moving to the new platform wouldn&#8217;t be such
a huge step.</p>

<p>I hope the photo in the article does not depict LG&#8217;s new phone, though.
The photo shows the Obigo browser, and if there&#8217;s one
browser you should definitely avoid if you want to give your users a forward-looking
browsing experience it&#8217;s Obigo.</p>

<p>That concludes my coverage of the MWC news. If you have more mobile browser news,
please leave a link in the comments.</p>

	IE6&#8217;s market share is about 80%.

Or would you reply that our sites should work as well as they can in all browsers

of the best practices we&#8217;ve been preaching for the past ten years?

I distinctly remember a time when we web developers cared about such concepts.

<h3>Warning! iCandy will damage your brain!</h3>

<p>Nowadays we live in a fantasy world that focuses exclusively on one platform,
and does so exclusively for reasons of eye candy.</p>

<p>We laughingly disown every single principle the web standards movement has ever stood for
in the past ten years in order to swoon and drool over Apple&#8217;s iCandy
and happily accept the reality distortion field that emanates from it.</p>

<p>The iPhone has become an obsession.
If we don&#8217;t pay attention, we&#8217;ll have a mobile web that only works on the
iPhone. And then we&#8217;ll have the <em>real</em> mobile web that wasn&#8217;t
made by us and doesn&#8217;t give a shit about web standards and best practices.</p>

<p>Worse, it seems web developers are happy with this state of affairs. It seems web developers
are <em>congratulating themselves</em> on excluding 85% of the smartphone users.
They certainly
never bother to check their sites in S60 WebKit, the largest smartphone
browser in the world.</p>

<p>Fucking dimwits.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re doing exactly the same as ten years ago.
We now say &#8220;iPhone&#8221; instead of &#8220;IE6,&#8221; but otherwise nothing&#8217;s changed.</p>

<p>No, wait, there&#8217;s one more change: the iPhone has <em>far less</em> mobile market share
now than IE6 had desktop share back then.</p>

<h3>Stats</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s illustrate that last remark with some
<a href="http://communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/2010/02/phone-market-shares-for-year-of-2009-and-last-quarter-2009.html"

<p>Let&#8217;s break these sales stats down by continent. Asia excluding Japan first:</p>

<p>Apple is second in every market, but the <em>least</em> difference with the market leader

<p>North Americans are parochial in their choice of a smartphone. One more reason why
the North American market has zero predictive value for the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Oddly, Europeans buy
relatively more Asian smartphones, while Asians buy relatively more European smartphones.</p>

<p>The Japanese market is so very different from all the others that I left it out. Besides,
a full 20% of Japanese smartphone sales fall in an unspecified &#8220;others&#8221; category.
Apple is fourth with 10% of sales.</p>

<p>The Japanese are even more parochial than the Americans when
it comes to selecting a smartphone, but that&#8217;s partly caused by the unique shape the
mobile space has in that country. None of the Western manufacturers has truly created an inroad
in the most advanced mobile market in the world.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the Japanese market <em>does</em>
have predictive value for the rest of the world, but it&#8217;s sometimes <em>so</em> advanced
that it&#8217;s hard to understand.</p>

<p>And here are the smartphone OS stats, also from Tomi Ahonen (whose

</ol>

<p>Despite the platform having only 15% sales market share we all want our mobile
websites to look exactly like an iPhone app and
we only want to use iPhone features.</p>

<p>We want to happily live forever in our fantasy world that&#8217;s filled to overflowing
with fucking iPhones, and where Nokias or BlackBerries aren&#8217;t welcome. Our
rationalisation machine is running overtime to maintain this illusion and filter
away reality.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re a bunch of lousy amateurs, that&#8217;s what we are.</p>

<p>No &#8220;mobile web development&#8221; specialist ever mentions Nokia ever.
After all, Nokia only sells more smartphones than BlackBerry and Apple
combined, so there&#8217;s no reason to mention it.</p>

<p>Mentioning Nokia is the mark of the rude boor. The man of discernment mentions the iPhone. And
mentions it and mentions it and mentions it. And then mentions the iPad, to show he is open
to non-iPhone devices. The bigger the better.</p>

<p>Oh, and don&#8217;t bring up Android. Yes, it&#8217;s an excellent system, and yes, it could have
a bright future ahead of it, but right now it doesn&#8217;t amount to anything in the global market.
It certainly won&#8217;t serve as a &#8220;Hey, I do multiple platforms&#8221; alibi.</p>

<p>15% + 4% = 19%</p>

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<p>&#8220;But ... but ... &#8221; I hear you sputter. Sputter on. You&#8217;re wrong.</p>

<h4>UX</h4>

<p class="but">	But the iPhone has the best user experience of any phone!</p>

<p>True. So what?</p>

<p>Whole flocks of web developers swear that their Mac is far more
user-friendly than any Windows machine that will ever be invented. Still, do they develop websites only for Macs?</p>

<h4>Safari</h4>

<p class="but">But Safari iPhone is the best mobile browser!</p>

<p>True. So what?</p>


<p>Firefox is the best desktop browser. (Or Opera, or Safari, or whatever.) Do you develop sites exclusively for Firefox?</p>


<h4>CSS enhancements</h4>

<p class="but">But Safari supports amazing CSS-driven graphic capabilities!</p>

<p>True. So what?</p>

<p>Use these capabilities, by all means. Just don&#8217;t depend on them. Don&#8217;t stare
at them obsessively for hours on end and then decide you&#8217;ve made your site &#8220;mobile
compatible.&#8221;</p>

<p>There&#8217;s this thing called progressive enhancement. It&#8217;s a neat trick that allows you
to use the iPhone&#8217;s capabilities without damaging the experience of users of other phones.</p>


<h4>Traffic market share</h4>

<p class="but">But Safari iPhone has about 50% of mobile internet traffic market share! You can&#8217;t
	ignore that, can you?</p>

<p>Watch me ignore it.</p>

<p>First, so what? No, let me rephrase that: So <em>fucking</em> what?
Since when does web development mean leaving 50% of your mobile users
out in the cold? Since when is &#8220;I only support browsers with a large market
share&#8221; a valid argument? (Answer: since we have an iPhone up our ass.)</p>

<p>Next, I&#8217;m not so sure if it&#8217;s true. Mobile browser detection is really hard.
None of the reports I&#8217;ve read so far show
<em>how</em> they detect browsers. Lots of mobile browsers have <code>iPhone</code> in
their UA strings to work around browser detects that obsessed web developers have set up.
Do all traffic market share reporters work around that problem? Most probably do, but we can&#8217;t be sure.</p>

<p>Besides, what will happen when the operators abandon the
economically untenable flat rate for iPhone data traffic? Will iPhone users
maintain their current traffic market share when they have to pay as they go?</p>

<h4>US doesn&#8217;t matter</h4>

<p>Next, many market share reports apply only to the US market, and it&#8217;s exactly these
reports that are discussed most by the influential American tech bloggers.</p>

<p>The real mobile battle, however, will take place in Europe and Asia. The US is a sideshow.
Unfortunately it&#8217;s extraordinarily hard to convince people, both Americans
and non-Americans, of that fact. So let&#8217;s try again:</p>

<p>Contrary to every single other technical advance of the last 50 years, mobile did not start
in the US, and the US has always been somewhat behind Asia and Europe. For instance,
SMS only <em>really</em> took off with the Obama campaign, while the rest of
the world became addicted to it years ago.</p>

<div class="floater smaller">
<p>Source: <a href="http://www.morganstanley.com/institutional/techresearch/pdfs/mobile_internet_report.pdf"
	class="external">Morgan Stanley Mobile Internet Report</a> (48Meg PDF) p. 75</p>
</div>

<p>While North America has 17% of the world&#8217;s internet users, it has only
7% of the world&#8217;s mobile users. Europe (22%) and Asia (45%) have the same figure for both.</p>

<p>The US market doesn&#8217;t have any predictive value for the rest of the world, either,
because Nokia is absent. It&#8217;s just a small niche market.</p>

<p>That means that, contrary to every other branch of tech, American mobile opinions just
aren&#8217;t very important to the rest of the world. For the American market, yes, of course they matter.
For all other markets, don&#8217;t listen to them.</p>

<p>The problem is that too much of the rest of the world takes its cues from
the well-read US tech bloggers that have made obsessing over Apple and Google while
being blissfully unaware of the rest of the mobile ecosystem into a fine art.</p>

<p>In the medium run the problem will solve itself. Either the US bloggers will catch up
with mobile reality, or they will cease to be read. I&#8217;m guessing the former.
They&#8217;re not stupid.</p>

<h4>Our fault</h4>

<p>But with all that said I still have no reliable traffic market share figures. So let&#8217;s accept that 50% of
	all mobile web traffic comes from the iPhone. Or 30%. Or 70%. Whatever. Far more than its
	sales market share, in any case.</p>

<p>Point is, <em>that&#8217;s our fault</em>.</p>

<p>I can vividly imagine an S60 WebKit user getting tired of shitty websites whose developers
	were too busy playing with their iPhones to bother with the largest worldwide
	smartphone browser.</p>

<p>We web developers are doing an <em>amazingly</em>
	lousy job right now. We have to start serious mobile testing instead
	of just playing around with our iPhone for a few minutes before declaring
	our site fit for mobile.</p>

<p>Supporting all browsers is the <em>whole fucking point</em> of being a
	good web developer, and I&#8217;m going to force you to do it even if I have to personally
	swear at each of you individually.</p>

<h3>Remove iPhone from ass</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m sick of the travesty that calls itself &#8220;mobile web development&#8221;
but mostly amounts to Apple-obsessed idiots with iPhones so far up their asses that
their brains are starving for oxygen.</p>

<p>Do you <em>ever</em> see any mainstream mobile web development article that talks
about S60 WebKit or the (lousy) BlackBerry browser? Due to our iPhone obsession we are
deliberately not paying any attention to a user group that&#8217;s four times as large as
the iPhone.</p>

<p>We have come full-circle back to developing for only one browser. Worse, we are
congratulating ourselves on that bit of cleverness.
Christ, do we <em>really</em> have to go through
the whole standards movement <em>once again?</em></p>

<p>True, the default browsers on Nokia and (especially) BlackBerry phones are less advanced than
Safari iPhone, but so what? Dealing with them is the job we signed up to do. Besides,
Nokia and BlackBerry are fully aware of the situation, and  I expect significant improvements
during this year. And if not, there&#8217;s always Opera.</p>

<p>As to traffic, Nokias and BlackBerries may consume less that their fair share,
but as I said earlier <em>that&#8217;s our fault</em>. We can&#8217;t use the mess
we created as an excuse to create an even larger mess. Besides, which web developer ignores
85% of his potential users? (The answer, obviously, is: one with an iPhone up his ass.)</p>

<h3>Work to do</h3>

<p>Web developers should take a look at their sites on a Nokia and a BlackBerry
and fix whatever&#8217;s wrong. It isn&#8217;t
<em>that</em> hard to get your hands on a testing device. Just ask around or use
<a href="http://perfectomobile.com" class="external">PerfectoMobile</a>. (I do not
trust emulators, so I don&#8217;t recommend their use.)</p>

<p>Install Opera Mini on the device, and also install Opera Mobile if you have a Nokia.
Check in both. The native browsers are more important, though.</p>

<p>Oh, and remember: Fixing a site
for a browser does <em>not</em> mean making sure the complete feature set works in that browser.
Use progressive enhancement. Lots and lots of it. Especially on BlackBerry.
That&#8217;ll keep you sane.
</p>

<p>Finally, I&#8217;ll be monitoring new mobile web publications, and
I&#8217;m thinking of instating an &#8220;iPhone Up Ass Award&#8221; for the
mobile web development article that ignores reality most
effectively. You have been warned.</p>

<p>If you write an article about mobile web development, I expect you to devote
a significant chunk of it to one or two specific Nokia or BlackBerry phones.
Show you can look further
than just the latest fad and see the mobile web in its entirety.</p>

<p>To those who <em>still</em> want to blather about seamless UX and
swoonworthy CSS and all the rest of the bullshit: why don&#8217;t you fuck the fuck off
and go wank your stupid iThingy elsewhere?
If you&#8217;re not interested in universal access you&#8217;re not a real
web developer and you don&#8217;t belong on the mobile web.</p>

<p>As for the rest of us, we&#8217;ve got work to do.</p>

<p>One reaction I received about my <a href="/blog/archives/2010/02/the_touch_actio.html"
	>touch research</a> was: Do we really need

touch and mouse events aren&#8217;t <em>that</em> different.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a fair question. It deserves a fair answer.</p>

<h3>The problem</h3>

<p>Right now, iPhone and Android support the touchstart, touchmove, and touchend events. Let&#8217;s say my
<a href="/browsers/touch.html">advice</a> is accepted and future browsers also
support the touchenter, touchleave, and touchhold events.</p>

<p>The point here is that this series of events isn&#8217;t that different from the mouse events.
Respectively, mousedown, mousemove, mouseup, mouseover, and mouseout fulfill the same role as
the first five touch events. The touchhold event does not have a direct mouse equivalent,
but it basically fulfills the same function as a right-click detection script.</p>

<p>So if mousedown is really the same as touchstart, why bother with new events? Can&#8217;t
we just write a mousedown script that is triggered when the user depresses his mouse button
OR touches the screen?</p>

<h3>The issues</h3>

<p>As far as I can see there are three fundamental issues involved:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Touch interaction is different from mouse interaction. Not hugely different, but different
	enough to warrant separate events.</li>
	<li>It MUST be possible to write ONE single JavaScript file that works optimally in any
	circumstances, on the desktop, in a mobile browser, or in a widget manager, with the user
	using the touchscreen, the mouse, or the keyboard, as he sees fit. That implies the
	web developer MUST be able to distinguish between mouse-driven and touch-driven interaction.</li>
	<li>The mouse events have already been implemented as legacy events in all touchscreen browsers. They
	all fire after the user releases the screen.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let&#8217;s study these issues a bit further.</p>

<h4>Issue 1: difference</h4>

<p>Although at first sight it seems as it touchstart is equal to mousedown, touchmove to mousemove,
and touchend to mouseup, this is not really the case.</p>

<p>Take a look at my <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/m/tests/scrollayer2.html">second scrolling layer script</a>.
It was written for touchscreen phones, and works perfectly if the browser supports the touch
events. Currently only iPhone and Android do.</p>

<p>I added the mousedown event to touchdown, mousemove to touchmove, and mouseup to touchup. Try
it in a normal desktop browser. You&#8217;ll find that, although the script works,
the interaction just doesn&#8217;t make
sense. The mouse events aren&#8217;t <em>quite</em> the same as the touch events, even though
they&#8217;re pretty similar.</p>

<p>For more fun, try using it with a touchpad.</p>

<p>If you <em>really</em> want to have fun, try the script on a Nokia S60v3 device, which has
a pseudo-cursor and implements the mouse events exactly like desktop browsers. The script works
... in a way.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong> to UX experts: how <em>should</em> the scrolling layer work when
the user has a mouse?</p>

<p>In other words, we need a different interaction model for desktop browsers. That requires us to
first make a distinction between mouse-driven and touch-driven browsers. But how?</p>

<h4>Issue 2: one file</h4>

<p>There&#8217;s one extra requirement: I absolutely want to be able to deliver one single JavaScript
file that contains all the scripts necessary for all interactions. And obviously I do not want to
use a browser detect at all in order to determine whether a certain browser needs the mouse or
the touch version.</p>

<p>So how do we distinguish between the two? Simple: see if a touchstart event fires. If it does,
the browser is certain to be a touchscreen device and we should disable the mouse events.</p>

<p>It would work something like this:</p>

<pre>
var testEl = [the element you want to do something with];
testEl.onmousedown = function () {
	// initialize mouse interface
}
testEl.ontouchstart = function () {
	<strong>testEl.onmousedown = null;</strong>
	// initialize touch interface
}
</pre>

<p>This works fine. The touchstart event fires before the mousedown event, and therefore we
can wipe the mousedown event handler before it&#8217;s ever executed.</p>

<p>A really proper script would have a third interaction model for using the keyboard. I haven&#8217;t
written that yet because it&#8217;s somewhat more tricky than the touch/mouse one. I
will have to deal with S60v3, where the &#8220;arrow&#8221; keys guide a pseudo mouse cursor
across the screen and both the mouse and the key events fire. Besides, the user may alternate
between the keyboard and either a mouse or a touchscreen.</p>

<p>Still, we can use a similar trick here: we know that the user is using a mouse if the mousemove
event is detected. More specifically, if <em>two</em> mousemove events are detected within a
short period of time. After all, all mobile touchscreen browsers will fire one (and only one) mousemove
event when the user releases the screen, and that does <em>not</em> constitute evidence for
a mouse-based interface.</p>

<p>Of course we can only distinguish them if keyboard use fires different events than mouse use. As
we know it does: the keydown, keypress, and keyup events have long been supported by all browsers.
Imagine a browser in which depressing a key would fire a <em>mousedown</em> event!</p>

<p>This sort of distinguishing between different interaction models is only possible if the three
models use different events. If the touch actions would also use the mouse events, it would be
impossible to distinguish between the two.</p>

<h4>Issue 3: prior art</h4>

<p>Finally, let&#8217;s repeat it once more, <em>all touchscreen browsers</em> (with the sole
exception of the two Vodafone Widget Managers) already fire <em>all</em> mouse events in
one long cascade when the user releases the screen.</p>

<p>We shouldn&#8217;t require all browsers to change this behaviour. First of all it doesn&#8217;t
make sense, and secondly they won&#8217;t all do it, leaving us stuck with an impossible
situation where some browsers support the mouse events as if they&#8217;re a desktop browser,
and others as if they&#8217;re a touch browser. That&#8217;s a recipe for disaster.</p>

<h3>Separate touch events</h3>

<p>So I strongly believe that all mobile touchscreen browsers MUST (in the sense of RFC 2119)
support separate touchstart, touchmove, and touchend events and relegate the mouse events to
legacy status.</p>

<p>Web developers will benefit from this since they can easily distinguish between the various
interaction modes and create scripts that are suited to every one of them.</p>

<h3>An error</h3>

<p>While tinkering with my <a href="/m/tests/scrollayer.html">scrolling layer</a> test page I
found out that I&#8217;d made an error in the first version. Oddly, this first version worked
absolutely fine on both iPhone and Android; that&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t notice the error at first.</p>

<p>I just plain forgot to give the <code>e</code> argument to the touchend function.
The script got its touchend information from the touchstart event object:</p>

<pre>
var testEl = [the scrolling layer];

testEl.ontouchstart = function (<strong>e</strong>) {
	// do stuff
	var origin = getCoors(e);
	testEl.ontouchmove = moveDrag;
	testEl.ontouchend = function () { &#60;-- forgot the e
		var end = getCoors(<strong>e</strong>);    &#60;-- e is touchstart object
		// do stuff
		testEl.ontouchmove = testEl.ontouchend = null;
	}

	function moveDrag(e) {
		var currentPos = getCoors(e);
		// move layer
	}

	function getCoors(e) {
		var coors;
		if (e.touches && e.touches.length) { 	// iPhone
			coors = e.touches[0].clientX;
		} else { 				// all others
			coors = e.clientX;
		}
		return coors;
	}
}
</pre>

<p>I found the error because I wanted to make the script
<a href="/m/tests/scrollayer2.html">desktop-compatible</a> in order to prove that from
an interaction point of view it makes no sense to just swap the mouse events in place
for the touch events.</p>

<p>I added mousedown, mousemove, and mouseup event handlers, saw an abrupt stop in Firefox
instead of the smooth stop, and discovered the missing <code>e</code>. Incidentally, this
proves that the mouse events do
not have persistent event objects (something we&#8217;ve known for 10 years, but still).</p>

<h3>Using one touch object</h3>

<p>My curiosity played up. Apparently, handling the touchend event with information
obtained from the touchstart event object works fine. Could I rewrite the script so that it <em>only</em>
uses the touchstart event object, and entirely ignores the touchmove and touchend objects?</p>

<p>The answer turns out to be Yes. The <a href="/m/tests/scrollayer3.html">following script</a>
works fine on iPhone and Android:</p>

<pre>
var testEl = [the scrolling layer];

testEl.ontouchstart = function (<strong>e</strong>) {
	// do stuff
	var origin = getCoors();
	testEl.ontouchmove = moveDrag;
	testEl.ontouchend = function () {
		var end = getCoors();
		// do stuff
		testEl.ontouchmove = testEl.ontouchend = null;
		setTimeout(checkOneLastTime,1000);
	}

	function moveDrag() {
		var currentPos = getCoors();
		// move layer
	}

	function getCoors() {

		// e refers to the touchstart event object
		// even if the getCoors function is called
		// ontouchmove or ontouchend. Works fine

		var coors;
		if (<strong>e</strong>.touches) { 			// iPhone
			coors = <strong>e</strong>.touches[0].clientX;
		} else { 				// all others
			coors = <strong>e</strong>.clientX;
		}
		return coors;
	}

	function checkOneLastTime() {
		alert(getCoors())	// works! event object still there
	}
}
</pre>

<p>In other words, the original touchstart event object persists even when
the touchstart event itself has long ended. Even better, it continues to be updated with
new information, such as the current touch coordinates.</p>

<p>I also read out the touchstart event coordinates one second after the touchend event
fired, i.e. when the entire touch action had totally and irretrievably gone. The event
object was still there, although its coordinates weren&#8217;t updated any more and it
ignored new touch actions.</p>

<p>I also tested whether the same is possible with the touchmove event. The answer
is Yes: a similar trick that uses a touchmove event object to retrieve information about
the touchend event works.</p>

<p>One could think that there is in fact only one single event object that all touchstart, touchmove,
and touchend events use. This turns out not to be the case (though it&#8217;s an interesting
idea).</p>

<p>When I added the missing <code>e</code> to the first version of the script it stopped
working on the iPhone. The script now used the touchend event object, which did not contain
the <code>touches</code> list because there were no longer any touch actions going on. I had
to move to the <code>changedTouches</code> list to get the coordinates I need.</p>

<p>This proves that all events still cause unique objects to be created: the touchstart
one contains a <code>touches</code> list; the touchend one doesn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Concluding, you can easily handle the touchmove and touchend
events by using the information contained in the touchstart object. There is no need
to access the touchmove and touchend event objects.</p>

<p>I wonder if this has performance implications. It probably won&#8217;t; the touchmove and touchend
event objects must be constructed anyway, since the browser has no way of knowing we won&#8217;t use
them. (Unless you use only one single event object for an entire touch action sequence.)</p>

<h3>Problems with the touch actions</h3>

<p>One of the most serious problems of the current touchscreen interfaces is that the
touch action is <em>way way</em> overloaded. When the user touches the screen he may want to start
a click action, a scroll action, or a resize action. Distinguishing correctly between
these three actions is what sets a good touchscreen interface apart from a bad one.</p>

<p>This is especially important with regard to the click action. Far too often, an intended
click on an element does not work because the user moves his finger a tiny little bit
during the action, and the operating system concludes he wants to perform a scroll action
instead. The page does not really scroll because the user does not really move his finger,
but the click action is canceled, and this results in a seemingly unresponsive interface.</p>

<p>This problem is especially severe in the Samsung WebKit that runs in the Samsung H1 and M1
Widget Manager, but it occurs on other operating systems, too.</p>

<p>Only iPhone and Palm have <em>really</em> solved this problem; the other browser vendors are
in various stages of catching up.</p>

<h3>Current state</h3>

<p>Events can be divided into three groups:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Touch events</strong> that describe the exact actions of the user on the screen without
	reference to the result of these actions. Examples: touchstart, touchmove, touchend.</li>
	<li><strong>Interface events</strong> that describe the result of the touch action. Examples: click, resize,
	scroll, contextmenu.</li>
	<li><strong>Legacy events</strong> that fire because many sites depend exclusively on them.
	Examples: mouseover, mousedown, mousemove, mouseup.</li>
</ol>

<p>The touch events are supported only by iPhone and Android, in that order. Even multitouch Androids
do not support more than one series of touch events (i.e. more than one finger) at a time.</p>

<p>All browsers support the legacy events, although some don&#8217;t support all of them. Still,
this is largely irrelevant.</p>

<p>The real chaos is in the interface event group. Most WebKit-based browsers support most events
reasonably well, but all others, including Opera and Firefox, don&#8217;t support them at all or
make a mess of them. That&#8217;s annoying, because it&#8217;s these events that actually tell
us what the user is trying to achieve.</p>

<h4>Touch events</h4>

<p>The touch events are touchstart, touchmove, and touchend. As you&#8217;d expect the first
fires once when the user initially touches the screen, the second continuously while the user is
moving his finger, and the third when the user releases the screen.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2008/07/10/touching-and-gesturing-on-the-iphone/"
	class="external">Touching and Gesturing on the iPhone</a> for more information on
how the touch events work on the iPhone. I do not repeat this background information in any of
my articles.</p>

<p>All browsers MUST (in the sense of RFC 2119) support these events at their earliest opportunity.
Any browser that does not support them by the end of 2010 is out of the mobile browser race.</p>

<p>The touch events are currently supported only by iPhone and Android.
There are a few differences between their models:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The iPhone also supports the gesture events, which fire when more than one
	finger touches the screen. I&#8217;m not yet totally sure how useful they will be;
	I&#8217;d like to see (or create) a practical test script first.</li>
	<li>The iPhone stores information about the touch, notably the coordinates, in
	a special <code>touches</code> interface, while the Android stores them directly
	on the event object itself.<del>Google is right, and Apple is wrong. I explain why in my
	<a href="/browsers/touch.html">advisory paper</a>.</del></li>
</ol>

<p>There is also the touchcancel event that fires when the user&#8217;s touch is &#8220;canceled.&#8221;
I haven&#8217;t yet studied it; I feel that it&#8217;s useful only in a very few edge cases.</p>

<p>The touchmove and touchend events also fire when the touch action moves out of the
element where the touchstart event took place.</p>

<p>If a touch action moves into an element, touchstart generally fires. I&#8217;m wondering
if we should use touchenter instead, which in turn presupposes the existence of a
touchleave event.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also wondering whether we need a touchhold event, and whether the touch events
should return an <em>area</em> instead of just a coordinate of a single pixel.</p>

<h4>Interface events</h4>

<p>The interface events fire when the user actually takes an action instead of aimlessly touching
the screen. These actions include:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Clicking on a link or otherwise activating an element. The click event should fire.</li>
	<li>Scrolling. The scroll event should fire.</li>
	<li>Zooming. We need a new zoom event for this situation. Currently a few browsers fire
	a resize event instead, but that&#8217;s not good enough, and it might be that resize should
	be assigned to another situation entirely. I need to do more research on this.</li>
	<li>Calling up a context menu. The contextmenu event should fire. More in general we might
	need a touchhold event that fires when the user touches the screen and holds his finger
	in place, whether or not a context menu pops up.
	On the other hand, this event is pretty easy to fake in JavaScript.</li>
</ol>

<p>Browser compatibility is a bloody mess:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The click event fires in all browsers.</li>
	<li>The scroll event does not fire in Opera, Samsung WebKit, Firefox, MicroB,
	and NetFront when the user scrolls.</li>
	<li>The zoom event does not exist yet; I&#8217;ve invented it during my research. We need
	it badly, though.</li>
	<li>The contextmenu event does not fire when a context menu appears in Opera,
	Android, MicroB, or NetFront. It fires correctly on Iris and IE. The other browsers
	do not have a touch-based context menu.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Legacy events</h4>

<p>Current websites are created exclusively for desktop, and they use the legacy events
extensively. Since mobile browsers want to give their users access to the &#8220;fixed&#8221;
web, they have to support these legacy events.</p>

<p>Still, the touchscreen environment is not the same as the desktop environment. Most
notably, a mouse action on the desktop is <em>not</em> equivalent to a touch action on
a phone. The user of a touchscreen phone needs to touch the screen for pretty much any action
(zoom, scroll, click), something that is not true for a mouse.</p>

<p>This is how the legacy events work currently:</p>

<ol>
	<li>If a touchstart and a touchend action occur on (roughly) the same coordinates this constitutes
	a touchclick action. The legacy events are fired, as is the click event.</li>
	<li>The legacy events are mouseover, mousemove, mousedown, and mouseup. The event
	order may differ, but that doesn&#8217;t matter. In addition
	the <code>:hover</code> styles, if any, are applied to the element.</li>
	<li>Only one mousemove event fires.</li>
	<li>When a touchclick action occurs on another element, the mouseout event is fired on
	the original element and the <code>:hover</code> styles are removed.</li>
	<li>The dblclick event is not supported. (It&#8217;s totally useless, anyway.)</li>
	<li>The Vodafone Widget Managers fire the mousedown event when the user initially
	touches the screen.</li>
	<li>S60 Widget Manager (Opera-based) and IE try to fire continuous mousemove events.</li>
	<li>Thus, the S60 Widget Manager in theory allows a mousedown/mousemove-based drag-and-drop.
	In practice performance is so painful that I advise you not to bother.</li>
	<li>iPhone and S60 WebKit cancel the rest of the events if a DOM change occurs onmouseover
	or onmousemove. I&#8217;m sure this is a good idea in the short run, but the mobile space
	will have to emancipate itself from the &#8220;fixed web&#8221; and this rule
	must eventually disappear.</li>
	<li>BlackBerry and NetFront do not support the mouseover and mousemove events.</li>
	<li>Palm, Samsung and Firefox do not support the mousemove event.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Drag-and-drop and position: fixed</h3>

<p>In addition to the <a href="/m/tests/touch.html">official test page</a> I created the
following tests:</p>

<ol>
	<li>A <a href="/m/tests/drag.html">drag-and-drop</a> script that works on iPhone and Android
	in addition to the desktop browsers. The trick here is removing the mouse events when the
	browser turns out to support the touchstart event.</li>
	<li>A <a href="/m/tests/drag2.html">multitouch drag-and-drop</a> script that works only on
	the iPhone. Android does not support more than one finger at a time.<del>The iPhone
	handles the touch event properties wrongly.</del></li>
	<li>A <a href="/m/tests/scrollayer.html">scrolling layer</a> script that works on the iPhone and Android.
	<a href="http://remysharp.com/"
		class="external">Remy Sharp</a> pointed out that it also contains the solution to
	getting <code>position: fixed</code> to work on the iPhone and Android.
	Essentially, if you make this script vertical instead of horizontal it&#8217;ll create a scrollable
	layer between &#8220;fixed&#8221; panels. There are various tricky bits involved, though, and
	I&#8217;ll have to return to this problem later. Still, we now have the basic solution.</li>
</ol>

<h3>iPhone clickable area</h3>

<p>I suspect that on the iPhone the actual clickable area is slightly
shifted downwards with regard to the visible HTML element. That is, a click just below the
element may also be counted as a click on the element itself. This does not go for the area
just above the element.</p>

<p>To try it for yourself, use the <a href="/m/tests/drag2.html">multitouch drag-and-drop</a>.
Try it in normal vertical orientation first, and try to touch the element as low as possible.
Then turn the device 180 degrees and try again. You&#8217;ll find that you have to touch
the HTML element distinctly higher now.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still trying to figure out how to officially prove that Apple does this; maybe
I&#8217;ve misinterpreted the test results.</p>

<h3>iPhone documentation is lousy</h3>

<p>Finally, during my research I noticed time and again how unbelievably lousy Apple&#8217;s
Safari iPhone documentation site is. I advise developers to use my pages instead &#8212; as usual.</p>

<p>Part of the problem is the content; once you get to the correct page you will find a terse
summary of the situation that is correct as far as it goes but mostly leaves out stuff that
doesn&#8217;t fall exactly in the page&#8217;s topic, even if it&#8217;s closely related.</p>

<p>Worse, the invention of the cross-reference has taken Apple completely by surprise.
I wish I could say it&#8217;s scrambling to catch up, but it isn&#8217;t. No cross-references
whatsoever. Anywhere.</p>

<p>Try it yourself. Go to <a href="http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariJSRef/TouchEvent/TouchEvent.html"
	class="external">the TouchEvent page</a>. It contains absolutely zero reference to
the crucial TouchList interface that exposes useful information about the touch events. There
is in fact a workable page about TouchList. Try to find it from the TouchEvent page. You
won&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Alternatively, try finding the same information from the
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/navigation/index.html"
	class="external">Safari Reference Library home page</a>. Search works &#8212; if you know
what to search for. The official navigation is absolutely useless.</p>

<p>Apple&#8217;s pseudo-frames or something also drive me crazy. The keyboard
focus does not snap to the actual documentation page, which means I initially can&#8217;t scroll.
(Firefox)</p>

However, I have decided that certain aspects of my professional life are in need of a change; notably my public speaking and my compatibility tables.

<h3>Conferences</h3>

<p>Basically I&#8217;m going off the conference track for a while in order to spend more time with my mobile phones.</p>

<p>I will honour agreements made beforehand, which means I&#8217;ll speak at the following occasions:</p>

<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.digitalsparksnw.com/transmissions/"
		class="external">Transmissions 3</a>, Manchester, 28th of January, together with <a href="http://my.opera.com/chrismills/blog/" class="external">Chris Mills</a>. The focus of this meeting will be the mobile Web.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.techniqueretreat.com/" class="external">Technique Retreat</a>, 29th to
	31st of January in Morecambe, near Manchester. Here I&#8217;ll be a trainer and workshop leader. If you want to do a bit of JavaScript or mobile web development with me around to help you, sign up. There&#8217;s still a few tickets left.</li>
	<li>Dutch: Sessie op de Howest te Kortrijk over het mobiele web, in de week van 29 maart.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.dibiconference.com/" class="external">DIBI</a> conference in Newcastle upon Tyne, 28th of April. I&#8217;ll speak about the mobile Web.</li>
	<li>It&#8217;s possible one item will be added to this list.</li>
</ol>

<p>After that, though, I will be very reticent in accepting new speaking gigs. The problem is not the speaking itself or hanging around at conferences with interesting people and beers, but the travel.</p>

<p>I have to travel to D&uuml;sseldorf at least once per month, and that&#8217;s OK because it&#8217;s always interesting and I&#8217;m also paid for this effort. Besides, I can do it by train.</p>

<p>Conference travel usually involves flying, though, and the latest round of air-travel-related hysterics starts to grate on my nerves. Once more we see an addition of pointless security measures that won&#8217;t make us much safer but will annoy the hell out of everybody in addition to cheerfully violating every single aspect of our privacy.</p>

<p>I object to the whole scare stuff; this is exactly what the bad guys want, and right now authorities around the world are being, well, authoritative and authoritarian in order to reinforce the terrorists&#8217; message. Stupid idiots.</p>

<p>I especially object to the requirement to put bananas in my ears for the entire duration of the flight in order to scare away the terrorists.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve decided not to come to SxSW this year. It will be hard on me once the happy tweets start to come in, but flying to the US is becoming less and less attractive, as is the formal content of SxSW. (The parties will be great, I trust.) I have no further US travel planned this year, and as far as I&#8217;m concerned I will not plan any, either.</p>

<p>In addition, conference speaking involves a significant investment of time, and I find myself less and less willing to do that, mostly because it leaves me too little time to do the fundamental mobile research I&#8217;m paid to do and want to do. Besides, I have an awful lot of writing to do about the mobile space, and that, too, is something that&#8217;s suffering from my being on the road so often.</p>

<p>Finally, I&#8217;ve given up JavaScript speaking entirely, and that has reduced my value as a speaker. Traditional web conferences aren&#8217;t really interested in the mobile Web as yet. That&#8217;ll change, but not this year.</p>

<p>Theoretically this loss of speaking gigs could be offset by invitations for mobile conferences, but it turns out that the mobile world has a strong cultural bias against paying flight and hotel for speakers.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ll have significantly less conferences this year than the past few years. Actually I&#8217;m looking forward to that.</p>

<h3>Compatibility tables</h3>

<p>The second change is my view of my <a href="/compatibility.html">compatibility tables</a>.</p>

<p>A year ago I already noticed that I became less and less interested in measuring the desktop browsers&#8217; compatibility. Everybody just supports all the standards, even IE, and in my last round of desktop testing I did not encounter even one juicy new bug. Great for web development, boring for me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been into the mobile Web for eleven months now, and there&#8217;s little chance I&#8217;ll ever return to the &#8220;fixed web&#8221; and its fast-decreasing problems. That will have consequences for the tables.</p>

<p>When I started my mobile research last March I automatically opened my desktop test pages on mobile phones and as usual started to create tables with test results. There were far less problems than I expected; even purportedly bad browsers such as BlackBerry, NetFront and Obigo supported quite a bit of CSS and JavaScript.</p>

<p>However, now that I&#8217;ve worked on the mobile browsers for a while it&#8217;s becoming increasingly apparent that I&#8217;ve been testing for the wrong stuff.</p>

<p>What I&#8217;m doing in the tables is atomic feature testing. Does browser X support the <code>+</code> selector, or <code>querySelectorAll</code>, or whatever? It turns out that this is the wrong question for mobile.</p>

<p>Mobile browsers have trouble not so much with atomic support, but with supporting the unified whole of web technologies. The BlackBerry browser scores surprisingly well on an atomic level, but once you actually send it a medium-complex JavaScript it gives up and hangs. That&#8217;s something you&#8217;ll never figure out when you only run tests like mine.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve started to change my focus. For the past two months I&#8217;ve been doing fundamental research into several areas:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Window and viewport width, with emphasis on media queries. If you use <code>@media all and (max-width: 400px)</code>, exactly which element is measured to see if it&#8217;s smaller than 400px? The answer turns out to be so complicated that I have to redo all my tests to make sure I&#8217;m right. It seems I found at least three different models.</li>
	<li>If you touch the screen of a touchscreen, exactly what happens? Which events fire? How does the browser distinguish between a click and a scroll action? (The short answer is: badly.) I&#8217;m not yet ready with this research; creating the test page took more time than I thought.</li>
	<li>HTML5 (according to my own definition). This is going slowly. How do you test the online and offline events on mobile phones? Ideally, I&#8217;d have to break the data connection without changing anything on the phone itself, because that&#8217;s what will happen in practice. But how?</li>
</ol>

<p>These examples show that my mobile research will have to move beyond the relatively simple tests I&#8217;ve been doing on the desktop for so long.</p>

<p>In turn, that means that I have to change my compatibility tables somehow. I&#8217;m not yet sure how I&#8217;m going to change them and whether I will give up desktop research entirely.</p>

<p>I will continue to host the old ones even if I decide not to update them any more, so you can still come here to find answers to the more basic compatibility questions. But expect some changes to the tables. </p>

the HTML5 spec actually is. I don&#8217;t have any doubts
on that score: HTML5 is anything you want it to be as long as it&#8217;s
new and cool.

In  a discussion on the WHAT-WG IRC channel
Jeremy got fed up
with the fact that he can&#8217;t just point people at the spec
during his HTML5 evangelism:


I'm doing my damndest to evangelise HTML5 to front end developers and designers but you guys don't make it easy.
[...]
As if this stuff wasn't confusing enough for authors already. Now they have to put up with stupid spec obfuscation for the sake of some minor semantic victory for someone somewhere.
[...]
The WHATWG couldn't make the spec more author-unfriendly if they tried.


Inevitably, it was pointed out that specs aren&#8217;t meant
for developers but for browser vendors. That&#8217;s true but unhelpful, just as it has
been for the past ten years. The ritual dance begins anew.

Personally, I&#8217;m not going to take part in the dance this time. I already know
what the outcome is going to be, and I&#8217;m going to skip the rituals.

Because &#8220;HTML5&#8221; is so vaguely defined we web developers can decide for ourselves
what is part of HTML5 and what isn&#8217;t, and that&#8217;s something I&#8217;m looking
forward to. (If spec defenders don&#8217;t like that they should
have been clearer.)

My favourite examples are geolocation and
Web Storage,

compatibility tables despite the fact that they&#8217;re not in the spec.

They&#8217;re in my HTML5 spec.

HTML5 is the continuation of Web 2.0 by other means, just as Web 2.0 was
the continuation of DHTML.
Apparently we need a vague, all-encompassing term for cool new stuff that we want
browsers to support and clients to buy so we can play with it.

That&#8217;s what HTML5 should be. Because there are new and exciting
things going on, people will start to make
wish lists. Exactly which items on those lists are described in a document called
&#8220;HTML5&#8221; will slowly cease to matter, as long as they have some browser support.

As soon as a certain
feature appears on enough HTML5 lists it will become canonical.
Conversely, the stuff that nobody&#8217;s really interested in will no longer be
HTML5, even if it&#8217;s in a spec with that name.

I consider this a Good Thing. Wisdom of the crowds and all that.

<p>I was never a big player of video games growing up, but I’ve recently gotten engrossed in them by way of my children. My older son plays New Super Mario Bros. Wii with me. Having finished all the worlds together, I find myself going back and collecting the “Star Coins,” of which there are 3 on each level. Some are cleverly hidden, others are out in the open but difficult to get. Collecting them unlocks in-game hint movies, all of which are more easily playable on Youtube — <em>even my six-year-old son knows this</em> — but still, I spend hours collecting them, and he high-fives me whenever I unlock a new movie.</p>
<p>It pains me to think that he might grow up doing the same with his cubicle-mates around some future version of Ribbon Hero and some future version of Office, but I suspect that’s the direction we’re headed.</p>

Cast in the light of a rather enjoyable <a title="Link to IMDb on The Boondock Saints" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144117/" target="_blank">action film</a>, the sequence mimics the spirit of a Twitter throwdown that Mr. Stocks ignited this February with one simple tweet: “<a title="Link to a tweet by Elliot Jay Stocks" href="http://twitter.com/elliotjaystocks/statuses/9227592793" target="_blank">Honestly, I’m shocked that in 2010 I’m still coming across ‘web designers’ who can’t code their own designs. No excuse.</a>”</p>
<p>As you can imagine, this sort of statement created a charged atmosphere in the web designer tweet zone. <a title="Link to a tweet by @beep" href="http://twitter.com/beep/statuses/9244665206" target="_blank">People</a> <a title="Link to a tweet by @snookca" href="http://twitter.com/snookca/statuses/9244856588" target="_blank">had</a> <a title="Link to a tweet by @simplebits" href="http://twitter.com/simplebits/statuses/9244893269" target="_blank">opinions</a>, <a title="Link to a tweet by @meyerweb" href="http://twitter.com/meyerweb/statuses/9245739144" target="_blank">they</a> <a title="Link to a tweet by @lloydi" href="http://twitter.com/lloydi/statuses/9245599897" target="_blank">shared</a> <a title="Link to a tweet by @andybudd" href="http://twitter.com/andybudd/status/9228953354" target="_blank">them</a>. Those were just a few examples. In general, things got a bit tense. It’s rather reminiscent of the last time I saw this topic come up during October ‘09 (I’d joined in with a post about it which you can read <a title="Link to CSSquirrel Post: Designers and Code" href="http://www.cssquirrel.com/2009/10/14/designers-and-code/">here</a>).</p>
<p>Should web designers know how to code in order to be taken seriously?</p>
<p>Jeff Croft’s response to the reignited brawl is to the point (warning – profanity-laced): You can read it <a title="Link to a tweet by Jeff Croft" href="http://twitter.com/jcroft/statuses/9246215722" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>It’s always a very fascinating argument when this topic comes up. I’d like to hear your thoughts on it: Should web designers know code?

		<p class="preamble">Being a pretty big fan of many winter sports I have spent most evenings of the past two weeks in front of the TV, watching the action from the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>With excellent live TV coverage from the games I had no reason to visit either the <a href="http://vancouver2010.com/">Vancouver2010.com</a> or the <a href="http://ctvolympics.ca/">CTVOlympics.ca</a> website to find more info about the games. But one person who <strong>has</strong> visited and taken a closer look at those sites is Joe Clark. What he found is that the <a href="http://joeclark.org/access/webaccess/vancouver2010/">Vancouver Olympics Web sites are inaccessible to disabled people</a>.</p>

		<p><a href="http://twitter.com/timbray/status/9801470243">Tim Bray asks</a> how to root the <a href="http://www.google.com/phone/">Nexus One</a>. The process is a bit complicated, but (unlike most other Android phones) it does not rely on exploiting security holes. <a href="http://androidandme.com/2010/01/hacks/video-how-to-unlock-and-root-a-nexus-one/">Android and Me has a great tutorial</a>, so I won’t repeat the gory details here. The key is in step 1, the <code>fastboot oem unlock</code> command. This does two important things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allows you to install custom “recovery” firmware (of which more in a moment).</li>
<li>Irrevocably voids your warranty. Seriously, this trips a “security” bit somewhere deep within the phone that <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=613842">no one has been able to reset</a>. Once you run <code>fastboot oem unlock</code>, your carrier will be able to tell that you did it, and they can (and most likely will) deny you service if you send your phone in for repair.</li>
</ol>
<p>(I am aware that there are other devices that give you root access from the get-go, but I find this an interesting compromise between the needs of carriers to reduce support costs and the desires of people like me to do whatever they want with their own computers. It’s not an ideal situation, but considering that the only way to root the G1 was to downgrade your OS to a vulnerable version and exploit a gaping security hole, the N1 is certainly a step in the right direction.)</p>
<p>The “recovery” firmware is what installs OS upgrades and other low-level packages. The built-in recovery firmware will only install packages signed by Google. Custom recovery firmwares remove this restriction, allowing you to install a multitude of custom OS packages (colloquially called “ROMs,” despite being read/write). I recommend <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=611829">Amon_RA’s recovery firmware</a>; the Android and Me link has installation details.</p>
<p>Once you have Amon_RA’s recovery firmware installed, you can install essentially anything on your Nexus One, including replacing the entire operating system. The custom recovery firmware also has a number of useful features, including low-level backup and restore functionality (called “NAND backup”) in case you install an bad custom ROM that crashes your phone.</p>
<p>The least invasive thing to install is <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=613812">Cyanogen’s N1 Addon</a>. This is not a full OS replacement; it simply installs the all-important <code>su</code> binary and a userland application called “Superuser Permissions,” which lets you manage which applications can have root access. Once Cyanogen’s N1 Addon is installed, you can search the Android Market for things that require root access. Three that I have installed right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>N1 Torch, which uses the camera flash bulb on the back of the phone as a super-bright flashlight. (Seriously, this alone is worth the hassle of rooting your phone.)</li>
<li>AdFree, which overwrites your phone’s <code>/etc/hosts</code> file to remove selected in-app and in-browser advertising.</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-wifi-tether/">Wireless Tether for Root Users</a>, which turns your phone into a wireless hotspot for your laptop or other computers.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to go further, you can install a complete OS replacement. I personally use <a href="http://forum.cyanogenmod.com/index.php?/topic/150-cyanogenmod-for-nexus-one-v5041-02272010/">Cyanogenmod</a>. Another solid contender is <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=614427">Enomther’s “TheOfficial” Nexus1</a>, which focuses on customizability. (Open the terminal app and run <code>expsetup</code>.) There are others, but I haven’t experimented with them.</p>
<p>The place to be to learn more about modding your Nexus One is the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=559">xda-developers forum</a>. Their <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=619153">adb/fastboot/bootloader/android 101 newbie guide</a> is essential reading; it explains all the terminology that modders use, as well as the most common <code>adb</code> and <code>fastboot</code> commands.</p>
<p>[Standard disclaimer: I work for Google, which develops Android and sells the Nexus One. Google gave me a Nexus One as a holiday gift last year, and I&#039;ve been using it ever since.]</p>

		<p>I’ve finally (albeit weeks later than intended) created a primer on linear gradients with CSS. It’s a shallow dip into the deep pool of CSS gradients, but it’ll help get you started on taking advantage of gradients with Webkit, Firefox and even Internet Explorer! (Yes, really.)</p>

		<p><a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2010/02/24/the-game-is-afoot">The appendices of the CSS specification are in alphabetical order</a> was one of those posts that gets stuck, trapped in your head for several days. Ideas bubble, but nothing will form shapes of words or sentences proper. But that phrase seemed to be rhythmically, well, <em>soothing</em>. Words make rhythm and music. More accurately, <em>syllables</em> have rhythm; words and sentences, music. <em>Great</em> writers can take liberties with them all, mixing silence in with the banter. (Parentheses and) <em>emphasis</em> like Word. Caps. are tricks for unspoken words.</p>
<p>This sentence was the first that I wrote (I added links to Hofstadter later):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The appendices of the CSS <b>2.1</b> specification are in alphabetical order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Head-scratchingly, it felt like it was… off. Why? The number syllables wrecked it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The appendices of the CSS <del>2.1</del> specification are in alphabetical order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, suddenly, it was clear to me why <em>this</em> version had familiar rhythm. Here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_on_the_Beach">Einstein on the Beach</a>, which is a song sung for kooks and lunatic madmen. (No, seriously, listening to just one of the acts is plenty to start with.) <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Philip+Glass/_/Act%2BIII%252C%2BScene%2B1%253A%2BTrial%252FPrison">Scene one in the third</a> is like a chant — mixing, blending, jumbling parts of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bank robbery is punishable by twenty years in federal prison.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, count in your head where the words, stresses, breaks, and “notes” are occurring.</p>
<blockquote class="c1">
<p><b>BANK</b> · <b>ROB</b> · ber · y · is · <b>PUN</b> · ish · a · ble · <b>BY</b> · <b>TWEN</b> · ty · <b>YEARS</b> · in · <b>FED</b> · er · al · <b>PRIS</b> · on</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now listen to the emphasis in <em>my</em> phrasing, matching syllables loosely.</p>
<blockquote class="c1">
<pre>
<b>THE</b>  · ap · <b>PEN</b>  · di  · ces · of · the · 
<b>BANK</b> ·    · <b>ROB</b>  · ber · y   · is ·

<p>I just recently was sleeping on the couch, music playing. Could I have dreamt it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bank robbery is punishable by twenty years of lunatic madmen.</p>
<p>The appendices of the CSS specification are carried everywhere with me.</p>

<p>Or, is there a simpler cause? Twenty years of hearing that piece, now <em>my</em> brain is rewired to hear music, carried everywhere with me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bank robbery is punishable by stresses, breaks, and federal prison.</p>

<p>But, doubtlessly, that’s where it’s from: Philip Glass’ “Einstein on the Beach.”</p>

		<p>The other day, as I was skimming <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> for my daily fix of <a href="http://www.thestar.com/opinion/article/757917--literacy-is-not-enough-if-content-is-mental-junk-food">mental junk food</a>, I stumbled across an old lecture by Douglas R. Hofstadter, <a href="http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/analogy.html">Analogy as the Core of Cognition</a>. A bit of <abbr>URL</abbr>-hacking then led me to <a href="http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/">this introduction of the man himself</a>, which briefly describes his major works, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach">Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</a>, which I first read in a delightful Logical Systems class in college, and which will be the only book in my backpack when I get to <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/11/03/the-pursuit-of-happiness">step 7 in my pursuit of happiness</a>, though by then we need to be able to buy unencumbered <abbr>PDF</abbr>s of such things, because damn — and I mean this quite literally — that book is heavy. Seriously, Amazon pegs it at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Godel-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567">832 pages and 2.4 pounds</a>. That’s almost enough reason to buy a Kindle. <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/11/19/the-future-of-reading">Almost</a>.</p>
<p>Hofstadter also wrote a book called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamagical_Themas">Metamagical Themas</a>, which before that was the title of a column he wrote for <cite>Scientific American</cite> in the early 80s. His column was the successor to Martin Gardner’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner#Recreational_mathematics">Mathematical Games</a> column, which later served as the inspiration for several of my <a href="http://diveintomark.org/projects/classic/">early Free Software games</a>. “Metamagical Themas” is, of course, an anagram of “Mathematical Games,” a fact which I somehow missed until it was pointed out to me by a now-ex-girlfriend for whom Hofstadter was also a literary hero.</p>
<p>Eventually, the introduction led me to <a href="http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/extras.html">this page of “Hofstadteriana”</a>, which includes <a href="http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/autolipography.html">Autoportrait with Constraint</a> (written without the letter E — a feat <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/02/05/writing-with-ease">I have also attempted</a>), <a href="http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/imagegallery.html">a selection of ambigrams</a> (like optical illusions, but with words), and <a href="http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/potpourri.html">this potpourri of other random excerpts</a>. This essay about <a href="http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/excerpts.html#gebxx">what <abbr>GEB:EGB</abbr> is really all about</a> is interesting, too.</p>
<p>(Good writing, bad writing, great writing, and the differences between them, <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/03/24/x">is something I’ve discussed here before</a>. But the letter to the editor described in <a href="http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/potpourri.html#meta">For Meta, For Verse</a> just makes me want to throw away everything I’ve ever written and <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2010/02/23/simplicity-is-hard-lets-go-shopping#comment-13827">go live in a wooden hut</a>. Let me put it another way. On a good day, Techcrunch is bad writing. On a bad day, I strive for at least good writing. But what Douglas does is… something else altogether. That poem is proof.)</p>
<p>After reading about ¾ of the introduction page, I noticed that the first word of every paragraph was bolded, and furthermore that the last letter of every paragraph was italicized. Aha! The game is afoot! My suspicions were confirmed shortly thereafter. The initial bolded letters of each paragraph spell out “D-O-U-G-L-A-S-R-H-O-F-S-T-A-D-T-E-R,” which spells “Douglas R. Hofstadter.” But the final italicized letters of each paragraph seemed to spell out nothing at all: “l-a-s-i-p-a-n-y-e-h-t-r-o-w-n-e-l-g.” But of course! If the first letters spell something <em>forwards</em>, the final letters should spell something <em>backwards</em>. And so they do: they spell “Glen Worthey napisal.” Checking the page footer confirmed that the entire text was indeed written by one Glen Worthey, and as best as I can tell, “napisal” is a Polish word meaning “author” or “authored.” Glen Worthey wrote this. Aha!</p>
<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/214/">Meanwhile</a>, a bit closer to home, <a href="http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20100211#l-939">I recently learned</a> that the appendices of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/#minitoc">the CSS 2.1 specification</a> are in alphabetical order. I’m going to repeat that because it’s doubly awesome: <em>the appendices of the CSS specification are in alphabetical order</em>. “Appendix A. Aural style sheets,” “Appendix B. Bibliography,” “Appendix C. Changes.” Hmm, could be a coincidence. “Appendix D. Default style sheet for HTML 4.” Suspicious, but plausible. “Appendix E. Elaborate description of Stacking Contexts.” OK, now you’re just fucking with me. And so on, up until “Appendix I. Index.” (But, even more interestingly, not including Appendix H (!), which is absent from both the “mini-TOC” and the full table of contents, but which <em>is</em> present within the text of the specification itself, for example by going to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/indexlist.html">Appendix I</a> and clicking “previous.”)</p>
<p>Early on, I had tried to do something similar while writing <a href="http://diveintopython3.org/">Dive Into Python 3</a>. Unfortunately for fans of constrained writing everywhere (both of you), the constant rearranging, merging, adding, and removing chapters led me to abandon that effort. But learning about the easter egg in the CSS spec prompted me to try again, and now if you skim through the online edition, you’ll see that the initial drop caps in each chapter are in alphabetical order from A to U. Maybe it’s not Hofstadterian, but I’ll be damned if I’m going to be outdone by <em>the appendices of the CSS specification</em>. Still, if the pen is mightier than the sword, I feel like I’m still learning how to unsheath the damn thing and wave it around. And Douglas R. Hofstadter is a level 60 samurai.</p>

		<p>As part of my <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/11/03/the-pursuit-of-happiness">pursuit of happiness</a>, I have been steadily <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/01/24/attachments-2">shedding attachments</a>, getting rid of things I don’t use, <a href="http://mark.pilgrim.usesthis.com/">thinking about ways of keeping the things I do use longer</a>, and just generally being a pain in the ass.

<p>Herself: What do you want for your birthday?</p>

<p>Her: You’re impossible to shop for.</p>
<p>Me: Actually, I want less than that. I want you to let me sell my car and replace it with nothing.</p>
<p>Her: Be realistic. We live in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Me: I have a bike.</p>
<p>Her: But what if my van breaks down?</p>
<p>Me: We have AAA.</p>
<p>Her: It would still put a huge burden on me if we only had one vehicle.</p>
<p>Me: That’s why it’s called a “gift.”</p>
<p>Her: You’re getting restaurant gift cards. And socks.</p>
<p>Me: I don’t need socks.</p>

<p>Apropos of nothing, I would just like to point out that the title of this post is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowclone">snowclone</a>, which itself is a word that I learned in the process of researching the exact wording of the original phrase of which it is a snowclone (“Math is hard. Let’s go shopping!” from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie#Controversies">Teen Talk Barbie</a> circa 1992). Not knowing whether I should write “simplicity is hard” or “simplicity is tough,” I searched Google for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22let's+go+shopping%22+math+barbie">“let’s go shopping” math barbie</a>, and the first result was a Language Log article called <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002892.html">Tracking snowclones is hard. Let’s go shopping!</a> which is both self-referential in the obvious sense, and also wonderfully meta-referential in that Language Log <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000350.html">was instrumental in coining the word “snowclone”</a> in the first place, but now can not possibly keep track of the snowclones, as seen by the lengthy update to that very post “added for those who find this via the Wikipedia entry for ’snowclone’,” which would be… me. And damn it, now I’ve spent the last two hours on a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WikiWalk">wiki walk</a>. (And <em>now</em> I’ve (re)introduced you to TvTropes, so, you know, there goes your evening and most of your night. Try to come up for air before dawn.)</p>
<p>My point, such that I have one, is that simplicity is easy to describe but difficult to achieve. Especially (though not exclusively) when there are other people in your life. While I applaud <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/austria/7190750/Millionaire-gives-away-fortune-that-made-him-miserable.html">millionaires who decide to give away all their money</a> (I say “their” money instead of “his” money, since even if he made the bulk of it, I can’t imagine him being able to give it away without his wife’s consent), the reality at home is more droll. Take, for instance, the television in our bedroom. It is small, as televisions go, costing no more than $100. It was once hooked up to a <abbr>DVD</abbr> player, which itself cost less than $50. Our children used to congregate in our bedroom after bath and before bed and watch 10 or 15 minutes worth of a movie or Sesame Street or some similar passive entertainment. I say “used to,” because in truth they stopped doing that about a year ago. No particular reason, just changing patterns. I pointed out to my wife that this would be a perfect opportunity to simplify by getting rid of the television and replacing it with nothing. That conversation went something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Myself: Can we get rid of this television?</p>
<p>Herself: No.</p>
<p>Me: But we never use it anymore.</p>
<p>Her: I’m sure that’s not true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I did what any self-respecting scientist would do when faced with an untested hypothesis: I devised a test. Which is to say, I unplugged it. The television. The power cord winds its way to a wall socket behind a dresser, which itself has to be moved in order to get at the socket, so my trickery was both non-obvious and difficult to counteract even if one should notice it. Which, of course, no one did. So there it sat, unused and unplugged, for over six months. Until one day, or rather one night, when we found ourselves in an old familiar situation — kids in pajamas, jumping on the bed, and so on — and my wife actually tried to pop in a <abbr>DVD</abbr>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Herself: The <abbr>TV</abbr> doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Myself: I unplugged it.</p>
<p>Her: When?</p>
<p>Me: About six months ago.</p>
<p>Her: Why would you do that?</p>
<p>Me: To prove we never use it.</p>
<p>Her: I’m trying to use it right now.</p>
<p>Me: What are you hoping to accomplish?</p>
<p>Her: I need to calm the boys down.</p>
<p>Me: And this need has not arisen in the past six months?</p>
<p>Her: We usually read books.</p>
<p>Me: Why can’t we do that now?</p>
<p>Her: …</p>
<p>Me: Can we get rid of the television now?</p>
<p>Her: No, we might need it.</p>
<p>Me: OK, but I’m not plugging it back in.</p>
<p>Her: I hate you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About five and a half months after that, which is to say about two weeks ago, I had <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/10/17/buying-art-online">bought some new art</a> and set about rearranging the walls to make everything fit. “Aha, an opportunity presents itself!” I thought to myself. You see, the (unplugged) television had always blocked a critical piece of real estate in our bedroom, above the dresser, in direct line of sight while lying in bed. The next morning, shortly after she had left the house to go to work, I disassembled the whole contraption, television and <abbr>DVD</abbr> player and all. I cleaned up an impressive amount of Assorted Random Crap that had accumulated around, behind, and beneath the television, I said goodbye to the final pile of physical discs in our house, and I hung one of my wife’s favorite pieces on the newly reclaimed wall in its place. When she came home, I gave her the grand tour of our newly rearranged walls, of course working up to the bedroom as the finale.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Herself: Yes! You finally got rid of that stupid television!</p>
<p>Myself: You know I unplugged it a year ago.</p>
<p>Her: Really? Why would you do that?</p>
<p>Me: It’s not important.</p>

		<p class="preamble">The way most people link CSS intended for different media types, such as screen, print, or handheld, is to use multiple files. The files are then linked either through <code>link</code> elements with a <code>media</code> attribute or through <code>@import</code> statements with one or more media types specified.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with splitting your CSS into multiple files and linking them this way (I currently do that here on this site), but there are two drawbacks: it leads to more HTTP requests from the browser to the server and the need to maintain multiple CSS files.</p>

		<p>I have decided to follow Dutch politics a bit more openly and to blog about it. Still, I don’t want to force this content on people that are just interested in web development. According to my own calculations the number of non-Dutch readers that are interested in Dutch politics is about twelve, so for those twelve, as well as the more sizable group of Dutch followers interested in politics, I’ve now created a <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/politics">politics homepage</a> and <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/politics/blog">blog</a>.</p>
<p>Swept away by the literally two requests from non-Dutch readers, I’ve also decided to publish my political primer, which will ideally consist of eleven long background articles, of which only the first eight are written. I will publish one article every Wednesday until I run out of material.</p>
<p>Here on the main QuirksBlog I may write some stuff about the JavaScript graph functions I created for the primer (<a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/politics/parliaments.html">parliament graphs</a>, <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/politics/table.html">tables</a>). Unfortunately, right now any JavaScript-focused article would mainly consist of a long list of features I haven’t implemented yet. Most of the graphs aren’t really keyboard-accessible, for instance, because I’m not happy with the idea of adding dozens of useless <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements just to make parts of the graphs keyboard-focusable.</p>
<p>All in all I’m hurrying to catch up with events. I hadn’t planned to publish any of this, but the government crisis has forced my hands. Please excuse the occasional wart or bug.</p>

		<p>As long-time visitors know I occasionally talk about Dutch politics here for the benefit of my Dutch readers as well as those twelve foreign readers that are interested in these matters. Since Dutch government fell late yesterday night, it’s time for another such post.</p>
<p>The Balkenende IV government (i.e. the fourth government that Balkenende (CDA) was prime minister of) was formed three years ago and consists of centre-right CDA (christian-democrats), centre-left PvdA (Labour), and orthodox-protestant left-leaning CU (Union of Christians). Yesterday evening the PvdA ministers resigned over a conflict about the continuing Dutch military presence in the Afghan province of Uruzgan.</p>
<p>In a week and a half local elections will be held, and the PvdA was slated to lose a lot of seats everywhere. PvdA party leader and finance minister Bos clearly hopes to stem the electoral tide by his resignation, and he might well be right.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: This will be the last political entry on the main QuirksBlog. I now have a separate <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/politics">politics section</a> with a blog as well as an article series about Dutch political history.</p>
<p>In any case I approve of Bos’s actions both from a policy and from a politics point of view. (Some Dutch readers will certainly disagree, and as long as they stay polite I don’t mind them commenting. These matters aren’t simple.)</p>
<h3>Policy</h3>
<p>The question was whether the Dutch military presence in the Uruzgan province of Afghanistan, originally planned to end by the end of this year, was to be extended for another period of time. The PvdA said No to this, while CDA and CU tended towards Yes.</p>
<h4>Uruzgan</h4>
<p>At the end of 2007 the Balkenende IV government decided to extend Dutch presence in Uruzgan for another two years, but commented that the final withdrawal would start in the second half of 2010. This withdrawal decision was repeated by parliament in a 2009 motion, with most of the opposition as well as PvdA and CU supporting the motion. Since then it has been clear that, although the CU might be convinced of staying in Afghanistan, the PvdA was against, and this standpoint clearly mirrored its electorate’s feelings.</p>
<p>What happened in the past few weeks is not entirely clear; in fact, PvdA party leader and finance minister Bos openly disagreed about the details with foreign minister and presumed future CDA party leader Verhagen in parliament. In Dutch constitutional law such sniping between fellow ministers is Not Done; government should form a coherent unity when it talks to parliament. This was definitely not the case in the last few days.</p>
<p>What is certain is that the NATO officially requested Dutch government to extend its mission in Afghanistan, a request that foreign minister Verhagen is now required to decline. I know little of NATO procedure, but it seems that declining such a request is Not Done. On the other hand, the NATO only makes such a request if it’s certain beforehand that the government in question will in fact accept it. Something has clearly gone wrong here.</p>
<p>The theory that was aired yesterday evening is that Verhagen had overstepped his mandate by informing the NATO that the Dutch would extend their presence while this matter hadn’t yet been decided on by government. Whether all this is true is uncertain, but from a politics standpoint this theory works in favour of the PvdA, as we’ll see in a moment.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s meeting of the council of ministers was slated to be the last one before the local elections (all ministers will be on the campaign trail next week), and the PvdA had demanded earlier that government rule out a continuing stay in Uruzgan at the present level, although alternatives, such as training local Afghan forces and helping with the development could still be discussed.</p>
<p>It seems that CDA and CU refused to rule out an extension of the Uruzgan mission. After a fourteen-hour marathon meeting the PvdA ministers decided to resign over this. They stated that their point of view was well known beforehand, and that parliament would never approve of an extended mission since the PvdA fraction would vote against it, together with most of the opposition.</p>
<p>And indeed, the PvdA’s point of view is no surprise to anyone who follows politics. What <em>is</em> surprising is that the PvdA didn’t cave in to the exigencies of power (as well as the CDA); a scenario that I, in any case, considered most likely until yesterday. The PvdA has rediscovered the backbone that went missing somewhere in the late eighties.</p>
<h4>The international angle</h4>
<p>Critics of the PvdA’s move point out that the country is making itself ridiculous in the international arena. Although they have a point of sorts, what surprised me most in yesterday evening’s coverage was that every single Dutch foreign policy “expert” was content to just repeat the US point of view without even thinking about it and without wondering what the Dutch and European interest in this whole affair is. They repeatedly conjured up Obama, who is kind of the iPhone of current politics, but did not make clear why we should unthinkingly support the US even when its policies make no sense.</p>
<p>Sure, the US will be disappointed because it’ll have to find another country willing to take over the Uruzgan province. Still, I feel that this is beside the point. The US strategy of occupying Afghanistan while chasing the pipe dream of making it a democratic country that will somehow magically transform itself into a reliable Western ally and a denouncer of everything Taliban is just wrong. Obama is just wrong with his troop surge; it does not serve any vital Western interest but is instead aimed at pacifying the proto-fascist wing of the Republican party that is beyond pacifying anyway.</p>
<p>As to the Al-Qaida training camps, what’s keeping Al-Qaida from moving them to another country? Sudan or Somalia or something? (In fact, they’ve likely already done so.) Occupying Afghanistan does not solve this problem at all.</p>
<p>Thus continuing presence in Afghanistan does not serve any Dutch or European interest, only a US domestic politics one. Besides, this policy will fail both in Afghanistan and in the US. So why not end our involvement now?</p>
<p>True, the now-crippled Dutch government, as well as its post-election successor, will catch some international flak. Still, the most likely net result of all this is that the Dutch prime minister will not be invited to have tea at the White House any time soon. That’s something we might conceivably survive as a country.</p>
<h3>Politics</h3>
<p>The politics of this move are considerably more complicated, and it’s in these politics that we discover the true reasons for the PvdA to resign.</p>
<h4>A flawed government</h4>
<p>The Balkenende IV government was flawed from the start. During the 2006 election campaign party leaders Balkenende (CDA) and Bos (PvdA) repeatedly clashed, and Balkenende succesfully painted Bos as a turncoat who time and again reneged on his promises.</p>
<p>The peculiarities of the Dutch political system forced both party leaders to cooperate after the elections, though, and they formed a government with an insincere smile plastered on their faces.</p>
<p>Argument followed protracted argument, and in the last year or so it became clear that it wasn’t a question of whether this government would fall, but when.</p>
<p>All this infighting has a long, long, history which you might one day read in my Dutch politics primer for foreigners. Suffice it to say that PvdA and CDA are long-time rivals, and that usually the CDA holds the upper hand because it has an alternative coalition partner in right-wing VVD, while the PvdA does not have such an alternative.</p>
<p>The PvdA wants revenge, and I tend to sympathise with that. The christian-democrats, especially the catholic ones, can be very, very slick and unpleasant to work with. The current state of affairs temporarily gives the PvdA the upper hand, and party leader Bos decided to use this leverage to the hilt. Good for him.</p>
<h4>Electoral reasons</h4>
<p>Thus, from a broad perspective the fall of government does not come as a surprise. Still, why now, and not earlier or later?</p>
<p>One reason is the upcoming local elections, which the PvdA was expected to lose dramatically. However, the national party leader keeping his back straight and not turncoating in the face of a christian-democratic onslaught might very well help the local party chapters.</p>
<p>Even better, the PvdA has made the difference between itself and the CDA very clear on a non-economic issue. The CDA has always succesfully painted the PvdA as the party of big spending (the reason Bos became finance minister is exactly to counter that story).</p>
<p>Therefore, breaking with government on a social-economic issue such as pensions or wages would be a political toss-up in the best case; a disaster for the PvdA in even a slightly worse scenario. Breaking on a non-economic, yet clearly important, issue is a much better idea.</p>
<p>Right now polls show that two thirds of Dutch favour leaving Afghanistan, with 45% feeling that this issue is worth a cabinet crisis (with 35% feeling it isn’t and the rest unsure).</p>
<p>The PvdA represents the voters better than the CDA right now. That’s unusual, and Bos is right in making use of that fact.</p>
<h4>CDA in disarray</h4>
<p>Besides, right now it seems that the CDA is in disarray and is decidedly less well prepared for general elections than the PvdA.</p>
<p>Although he has shown ample amounts of tenacity, prime minister and CDA party leader Balkenende has never truly convinced as a leader. All of his governments fell before their time, again and again he was unable to keep his ministers in check and provide overall direction to both party and country.</p>
<p>It might be time for the CDA to find a new leader. Now internal CDA fights are notoriously difficult to follow, and nobody knows exactly what’s going on, but one thing is clear: because Balkenende is a protestant, the next CDA party leader must be a catholic. And the highest catholic within the CDA is foreign minister Verhagen.</p>
<p>From this point of view, PvdA party leader Bos arguing with Verhagen instead of Balkenende makes a lot of sense. Bos tries to cripple the next CDA party leader before he’s even formally succeeded Balkenende.</p>
<p>It is very clear that a final decision on the transfer of leadership has not yet been taken. Such deliberations always take lots of time, especially with the christian-democrats who set store on proper, slow procedure that gives everybody and their dog a chance to say their say, although the final decision will rest with the party leadership.</p>
<p>Still, the CDA is now forced to choose between Balkenende and Verhagen quickly. Balkenende has about reached his Best-Before date, and besides he’s just lost his third cabinet from an internal argument that could have been prevented, and he’s definitely on the defensive against the PvdA right now.</p>
<p>However, a quick transfer of power to Verhagen might be even more problematic. First of all such transfers take time, time the CDA might not have with general elections looming near.</p>
<p>Secondly, it seems that the PvdA has tarred Verhagen very efficiently. Verhagen can easily be painted as yet one more insincere, sleek, slick, untrustworthy catholic politician; and this prototype has considerable power in Dutch politics. Non-catholic voters (even protestants who might otherwise vote CDA) are influenced by it. A CDA led by catholic Verhagen might be in for a rougher ride than one led by protestant Balkenende.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there’s orthodox-protestant CU. Of the three government parties it is the only one that has consistently shown a slight but definite gain in the polls, while both PvdA and CDA slid down. The question is whether left-leaning protestant CDA voters will leave their own party and vote CU instead. This is a disaster scenario for the CDA: the CU is the only party that can reach the CDA’s soft underbelly of Bible-inspired voters that the secular parties of left and right cannot touch.</p>
<p>Point is that the most efficient stop-gap against the CU is Balkenende, because he’s as protestant as CU leader Rouvoet is. If, however, a catholic were to succeed to the CDA party leadership, this might be the last straw for some protestant voters, and the CU might hugely profit.</p>
<p>Thus, although Balkenende is untenable, Verhagen is even more untenable. The only solution would be to elect a new protestant as party leader (there are several good candidates), but this will upset the catholic voters and party members as well as breaking a Sacred Rule.</p>
<p>The CDA faces a very tough choice. Even worse, it will have to decide very quickly, and if there’s one thing christian-democrats are bad at it’s deciding something quickly. On balance, it’s likely that Balkenende will stay. This is not a good choice, though, just the least bad one.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: The CDA party leadership has reelected Balkenende party leader with surprising speed. Apparently they feel the heat, too. But the CDA has now opted for the least bad choice.</p>
<p>Compare this to the PvdA, where it is clear Bos will again lead the party into the elective struggle crowned by the aura of this break in government. Besides, the PvdA seems to represent the will of the voters better than the CDA right now, its base has been galvanised by the totally unexpected show of backbone, and it is clearly unified and ready for battle.</p>
<p><em>Very</em> nicely played, mr. Bos. My hat is off to you.</p>
<h3>What’s next?</h3>
<p>Prime minister Balkenende will report to the Queen, who will ask him to form a temporary caretaker government (Balkenende V) consisting of CDA and CU. General elections are expected in late May or early June.</p>
<h4>Elections</h4>
<p>So what will happen in the elections? First of all, a caution against polls.</p>
<p>Right now the polls say that the PVV of anti-Islamic mouth-frothingly angry extreme-right Geert Wilders will become the first or second party of the country. I do not believe this will happen.</p>
<p>When elections are still far off Dutch voters tend to vote with their underbelly. Many people will tell the pollster they’ll vote Wilders just because they’re angry at government, politics, and the world at large. When actual elections come close, however, many of them will reconsider and in the end decide to vote for a more moderate party. Thus I expect Wilders to gain a few seats, but not too many. I’d say he goes up from his current 9 (out of 150) to about 12 to 15. But that’s about it.</p>
<p>How CDA and CU will do is unpredictable right now; we first have to see how the leadership fight in the CDA turns out. I expect the CU to remain at or near its current 6-seat level when a protestant is in charge of the CDA, and to grow somewhat (9?) when a catholic takes over. As to the CDA, it will certainly fall somewhat from its current 41 seats.</p>
<p>The PvdA will do much better than in the current polls. Right now the social-democrats have 33 seats, and the polls expect them to drop to 15 to 18. It’s virtually certain that Bos’s resignation will help the PvdA considerably, and will prevent seats seeping away to its three competitors on the left flank of Dutch politics. Maybe it will stay close to its current 33 seats; let’s call it 30 to 35.</p>
<p>Moderate right-wing VVD will win some seats and go up from their current 21 to about 28 or so. The VVD always wins after a spell in the opposition, and although it has not provided much inspired guidance, it’s available on the right while being neither CDA nor Wilders. That’s probably a recipe for electoral gains right now.</p>
<h4>New government</h4>
<p>The Balkenende IV government consisted of the largest parties of the left and right, and it was a miserable failure. It seems likely that the next government will have a more clear right- or left-wing signature; especially since the big policy question will be what to do about the crisis. Do we want a left-wing or a right-wing solution?</p>
<p>Now historically the right is slightly bigger than the left in Dutch politics. A left-wing government, which would have to consist of at least four parties, is possible in theory, but not very likely. At least, that would be the situation in most elections. However, this year there’s a problem on the right.</p>
<p>The combined parties of the right might very well obtain a majority in parliament, but the point is that <em>this includes Wilders</em>. In order to form a right-wing government, Wilders is indispensable.</p>
<p>Now this opens up perspectives for the parties on the left. If their message were to be “Vote CDA or VVD, and get Wilders for free” they might actually give some voters who feel at home on the right wing but despise Wilders pause. More specifically, it will give the (smallish) evangelical left wing of the CDA an additional reason to vote CU instead. Who knows, it might even cause some VVD voters to veer leftward to D66.</p>
<p>Thus these elections are likely to become interesting.</p>
<h4>Dutch politics primer</h4>
<p>For me personally the elections also mean a tough choice. From the previous 2006 elections on I have steadily worked on a Dutch political primer for foreigners. My plan was to publish it just before the next elections, which were originally planned for May 2011. However, the current crisis has moved that date down by a year, and I’m not ready yet.</p>
<p>Currently I’m not sure what to do, mostly because I don’t have a lot of time I can spend on the political primer before the elections. Three out of eleven articles remain unwritten, and the other eight still need a stiff edit. I also wanted to move some of the JavaScript-generated maps to SVG, but it seems unlikely that that’s going to happen any time soon. Content first.</p>
<p>We’ll see. I first need to know the election date, which will probably be announced in the next week or so.</p>

		<p>Yesterday evening I returned from my fourth foreign trip this year. This time I went to the <a href="http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/" class="external">Mobile World Congress</a>, the annual Barcelona-based get-together of the mobile industry, and I can tell you, it’s <em>something else</em>.</p>
<p>This post gives an overview of announcements by mobile players that might be of interest to web developers. There’s an incredible lot of it, too, because every single major mobile player except Apple feels that MWC is the ultimate forum for major announcements.</p>
<p>If you know of more news, or have links to additional information, please leave a comment.</p>
<p>I was there because Vodafone had invited me to sit on a <a href="http://mobilewidgetdev.wordpress.com/2010/02/05/its-not-easy-developing-for-mobile-an-expert-panel-discussion-at-mwc/" class="external">panel</a> in a technical “embedded conference” about W3C Widgets and related technologies. The concept can use some fine-tuning; I’m hoping to do some of that in the future. I was there mainly to stress that the mobile browser situation is not as simple as it looks. THERE IS NO WEBKIT ON MOBILE!<br>
While I was at it I also invented guerilla browser testing.</p>
<p>MWC is huge, and by that I don’t mean SxSW-style huge. You could drop all of SxSW smack-bang in the middle of MWC, and nobody would notice (apart from the people in the drop area). With only 50,000 delegates this was a decidedly bad year, as one Vodafone MWC veteran pointed out to me.</p>
<p>All major and a lot of minor mobile players were there, with the exception of Apple and (curiously) Nokia. Apple’s absence was expected; it follows its own unique trajectory and basically ignores the rest of the industry when it comes to announcements. (Apple might have a point here; it gets more attention for its announcements when they’re done entirely outside the MWC timeframe.)</p>
<p>Nokia’s absence created a huge buzz; it was the main MWC sponsor for many years before it suddenly withdrew this year. Unfortunately I’m not yet well enough versed in mobile political sciences to be able to explain this. (And don’t leave a “simple” explanation in the comments! This stuff isn’t simple!)</p>
<p>Phone-wise I was deep, deep inside BlackBerry land, as you’d expect with business executives and marketing people. There were few iPhones, I saw almost no Androids, though Samsung had a surprisingly solid presence.</p>
<p>Anyway, the main general question right now is when browsers will become a hot topic on MWC. This year they weren’t; the 30-minute panel for about 100 attendees I participated in was about the most browser-focused event of the entire conference. Still, I believe that browser quality is an emerging theme in mobile, so I expect a future MWC (next year? year after? 2013?) to be more browser-aware.</p>
<p>This will be something to watch; if even business executives start to seriously consider browsers, web technologies will have basically annexed the mobile space. That would be a cool extension to our current reach, right?</p>
<p>For those following the smartphone market Tomi Ahonen’s <a href="http://communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/2010/02/dispatches-from-the-front-line-war-reporter-checks-in-from-smartphone-wars-of-2010.html" class="external">smartphone war frontline update</a> is required reading. He currently expects Apple to be in serious trouble because Christmas sales were bad. It will be interesting to follow that storyline as it unfolds.</p>
<h3>Announcements</h3>
<p>Everybody and their dog considers MWC the prime venue to make exciting announcements. As a result you hear all announcements at once, and few make more than a fleeting impression.</p>
<p>Besides, MWC is not a technical conference. It’s a business and marketing conference where business and marketing people try to impress other business and marketing people by firing off a stream of tech-based buzzwords.</p>
<p>Neither the broadcasting nor the receiving party have the slightest clue what they’re talking about, and it’s this curious mechanism that gives all MWC-related press releases the unique vagueness that make them so hard to interpret by techies.</p>
<p>Nonetheless I’ve carefully gathered most (all? nah, probably not) announcements that are important to web developers. Here’s the list, in the approximate order in which they made a splash in web dev land.</p>
<h4>Microsoft</h4>
<p>Microsoft announced its new Windows Phone line which runs Windows Mobile 7, and a new version of IE that I currently expect to be based on IE8. I saw from my Twitter feed that this announcement was well-received. Unfortunately the Microsoft stand turned out to have no actual Windows Phones in it, so I couldn’t test anything and will reserve judgement until I’ve actually used one.</p>
<p>More in general, this is Microsoft’s last chance to matter on mobile, and they know it. Windows Mobile 6.1 is just spectacularly bad. Windows Mobile 6.5 is a lot better, but still no real competitor to iPhone, Android, or Symbian. Will Windows Mobile 7 help here? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>Obviously I’ll post a full test report as soon as I can get my hands on a device.</p>
<h4>Opera</h4>
<p>Opera was canny enough to send out its exciting announcement slightly ahead of the crowd. It will shortly submit Opera Mini to the Apple App Store. Although at first I doubted the technical wisdom of this move (Safari iPhone is far ahead of Opera Mini, which, after all, does not offer any client-side interactivity), I’m now starting to revise my opinion.</p>
<p>Personally, I’d welcome Opera Mini because my Safari iPhone has taken up the nasty habit of crashing on my <a href="https://webmail.xs4all.nl/plugins/xs4all_login/xs4all_login.php" class="external">webmail</a> site. The more I reload it (and have to re-login), the higher this crash chance is.</p>
<p>More in general, Opera Mini uses far less bandwidth than Safari iPhone because it sends a highly compressed version of the site to the phone. Right now that might matter on lousy connections (such as the ones in Barcelona, where 50,000 mobile professionals clogged the networks considerably). In the future, though, it will start to matter even more because eventually the operators will put an end to the economically untenable flat-rate iPhone data plan. When that happens Opera Mini will become an interesting alternative because it saves you money.</p>
<p>Still, the main point of this release is political. By publicly announcing their intent, Opera has put Apple in the position of either allowing the first competing browser on the iPhone or being slammed for not allowing it. (Currently all alternative iPhone browsers use the Safari rendering engine; Opera Mini would be the first to use a different one.)</p>
<p>It’ll be interesting to see how this one plays out.</p>
<h4>WAC and network APIs</h4>
<p>Then, no less than 24 global operators announced the <a href="http://www.wholesaleappcommunity.com/" class="external">Wholesale Applications Community</a> which aims at spreading applications to an installed base of not 100 million iPhone users, but 3 billion users of other phones.</p>
<p>This is typically something operator executives love; it’s an “answer” to the App Store (which, in my opinion, doesn’t need an answer because it’s slowly going to be transformed into a niche market mostly for games and other applications that need to be native, and not web-based. But I digress.)</p>
<p>Obviously, the announcement gave no technical details whatsoever. This is a business and marketing thing, after all.</p>
<p>Still, to anyone who spends more than half a second thought on it it should be clear that there’s only one single technology that gives the operators a fighting chance of attaining their objective: web technologies.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the fact that web standards are the obvious answer does not mean that they will actually play a role in the WAC initiative. Ignoring the obvious is something that executives are very good at.</p>
<p>Still, Vodafone is part of the consortium, and Vodafone is investing heavily in web standards (even to the extent of paying me to do fundamental research). So I guess we can hope. As far as I know the Vodafone widget-based system is currently the <em>only</em> one that works on more than one platform.</p>
<p>Related to this is the news that operators are working on “network APIs.” I’m not yet totally sure what they are (technical info, as usual, is completely absent), but it <a href="http://www.betavine.net/bvportal/resources/api/vodafonenetwork" class="external">seems likely</a> that they’ll include APIs for mobile payments.</p>
<p>The point here is that operator-based payments are the most user-friendly ones possible because, contrary to every single current app store, you <em>do not need to log in</em>. Your identity is ascertained through your SIM card, and the payment is added to your operator bill. Mobile payments cannot be made any simpler than that. (Besides, the operators obviously love this middle-man position.)</p>
<h4>BlackBerry WebKit</h4>
<p>Then BlackBerry announced that a new WebKit-based browser is coming up. This is no surprise to anyone following the mobile industry. About six months back BlackBerry acquired Torch Mobile, the creator of the Iris browser. Since the Iris browser scored rather well in my <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/webkit.html">tests</a>, it was obvious that BlackBerry wanted a high-quality replacement for their proprietary browser whose Best-Before date was reached somewhere in 2008.</p>
<p>As far as I know there were no actual devices with the new browser in Barcelona (but by the time this news reached me I had become very tired, and I didn’t try very hard to find them).</p>
<p>Still, the 100/100 Acid 3 score gives us a clue as to what’s going on. I <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/webkit.html">found</a> only four WebKit-based browsers with this score: Safari desktop and iPhone, Chrome, and Iris. (Android 2 not yet tested; wouldn’t be surprised if it scored 100/100, too.)</p>
<p>I assume that the Torch Mobile team has been working on an actual port of the Iris browser to the BlackBerry OS instead of creating a wholly new one. This would bode well for the mobile web.</p>
<p>But remember: <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/10/there_is_no_web.html">THERE IS NO WEBKIT ON MOBILE!</a> This is no iPhone WebKit magically transmuted into a BlackBerry application, it’s a completely separate WebKit implementation. A good one, most likely, but that doesn’t mean it’s the same as the iPhone.</p>
<p>Ignore any post you read about the new BlackBerry browser somehow making the creation iPhone-only sites more acceptable. That’s just uninformed nonsense. However, using BlackBerry WebKit as an additional argument for serious use of progressive enhancement, as <a href="http://forabeautifulweb.com/blog/about/do_try_this_at_work/" class="external">Andy proposes</a>, is an excellent strategic idea that’s worth a try.</p>
<p>Obviously I’ll post a full test report as soon as I can get my hands on a device.</p>
<h4>Adobe</h4>
<p>The Adobe stand was all about Flash, and sported the tagline “One Web, any device.” Although I agree with the basic sentiment, I’m not sure if Flash is going to deliver on that promise. I’d like a list of mobile platforms on which it is supported, but obviously the Adobe site doesn’t give any clue of that. (Nobody ever does that ever; everybody’s very vague about platforms and just assures anyone who’s willing to listen that <em>their</em> mobile solution works practically everywhere. But I digress.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/devices/mobile_flash_10-1_developers.html" class="external">This list</a> of mobile Flash videos is the closest I came, and it mentions Android and Palm, but no other platforms. Not exactly a huge user base.</p>
<p>The odd thing is that Adobe’s <a href="http://blog.distimo.com/2010_02_adobes-platform-to-deliver-apps-across-all-phones/" class="external">announcement</a> was not about Flash but about AIR. This, apparently, will be the technology to deliver content across all platforms — well, to Android and BlackBerry, at least.</p>
<p>We’ll see. The pro of AIR (or Flash) would be that it is the single RIA environment (except for plain old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) that works on more than one platform. The con is that it doesn’t work on <em>that</em> many platforms.</p>
<p>Adobe AIR uses WebKit, by the way. I never tested it, but it’s safe to assume that it’s different from all other WebKits.</p>
<h4>Samsung bada</h4>
<p>One of my personal top stories was the unveiling of Samsung bada (Korean for ocean; not capitalised), the new smartphone OS that runs a spiffing new WebKit implementation that’s different from all other WebKit implementations.</p>
<p>I give kudos to Samsung for actually allowing anyone to play with their new Wave phone in their stand. I took the opportunity to invent guerilla browser testing; I fired up the browser and did some very quick tests while standing in the Samsung stand. I returned twice when I’d thought of more tests to do. I crashed two phones in the process.</p>
<p>The WebKit-based browser seems to be called Dolfin; in line with the ocean metaphor that Samsung has chosen. It is not to be confused with the Dolphin browser for Android — I think.</p>
<p>The bad news is that Dolfin is not yet very good. The good news is that Samsung clearly stressed that the software wasn’t yet final; changes would be made. I hope they change a lot on the browser side of things.</p>
<p>I was able to prove that Dolfin is closely related to the widget manager WebKit on the H1/M1 Vodafone devices; something I’d more or less expected. There’s one bug in my still-unpublished width research that occurs only on the Samsung bada and widget manager WebKits, and nowhere else. (There is no “WebKit on Mobile!” They’re all different!)</p>
<p>As a whole bada seems a reasonably good platform. The point here is that it’s not meant as a high-end smartphone platform that competes with iPhone, Android, or Maemo, but instead a mid-range one that will compete with Symbian. Some quality has been sacrificed on the altar of affordability.</p>
<h4>Bolt and widgets</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://boltbrowser.com/home.html" class="external">Bolt browser</a>, which is the main competitor to Opera Mini, now supports W3C Widgets in version 1.7. Bolt is WebKit-based, by the way, but it’s different from all other WebKits.</p>
<p>This news is interesting because it requires Bolt to use a different architecture than the standard widgets W3C is defining and Vodafone and Opera are implementing. Such a widget is an application stored on the device that uses a full browser that offers full JavaScript capabilities to run in.</p>
<p>Like Opera Mini, Bolt does not support client-side interaction, but instead requires a full page refresh every time a script changes something to the DOM. Besides, the widgets cannot be stored on the device because there’s no full browser there, just a thin client that gets its instructions from the server. Therefore the widgets will be stored server-side. The downside of this is that you need something like a Bolt account to access your widgets. (Details aren’t clear to me.)</p>
<h4>Android</h4>
<p>Google’s announcement was that 60,000 Android phones are sold per day. Let’s be clear: this encompasses all Android phones, whether they’re branded by Google itself, HTC, Samsung, Motorola, SonyEricsson, or minor players. Still, it’s an impressive number that might upgrade Android to third-largest smartphone operating system in 2010, after Symbian and BlackBerry, but before the iPhone.</p>
<p>Still, all’s not well in the Android world. The problem is the Nexus One. Google’s release of its own branded phone (created by HTC) has widely been interpreted as a stab in the back of Motorola, who’s gambled its existence as a smartphone vendor (or even as a device vendor in general) on the Droid-centred Android strategy. The Google phone is obviously a serious competitor to the Droid in the eyes of the affluent tech-savvy US smartphone purchaser. (Motorola is irrelevant outside the US.)</p>
<p>To partly make up for that HTC unveiled the Desire, an HTC-branded and -skinned phone that runs on exactly the same hardware as the Nexus One. HTC’s brand awareness doesn’t come close to Google’s, but still it has a decent market share in Asia and Europe, and of the generic vendors without their own OS I definitely rank HTC first when it comes to interface design and general performance. They even made Windows Mobile 6.1 work — more or less.</p>
<p>Right now I don’t know how much all this matters. Some people will buy an Android phone specifically; others buy a SonyEricsson, HTC, or Motorola phone without knowing anything about the OS. Motorola will likely fall out of the race in 2010, and it could full well blame Google, but it’s certain that Google won’t care. Meanwhile it’s unclear whether Google cares about the HTC Desire.</p>
<p>In any case, of the sub-markets the Android one will remain by far the most complicated because there are so many players involved. Every single Android player, however, has at least one alternative platform in case of emergency. Except for Google.</p>
<p>Android will be one of the major unfolding stories of the year.</p>
<h4>Nokia and MeeGo</h4>
<p>As to Nokia, despite being absent from MWC it had one announcement for each of its smartphone platforms. Symbian^3, the successor to S60, is coming this year. No more details are known, but I expect its WebKit to be significantly upgraded. (It still will be <em>different from all other WebKits</em>, though.)</p>
<p>More interesting is the Maemo news, because industry pundits generally expect Maemo to become Nokia’s high-end smartphone platform, while Symbian will serve the low end and the business market.</p>
<p>Point is, Maemo’s gone. It has been merged with Intel’s Moblin platform to produce MeeGo (silly name in my opinion, but nobody asked me). I have no clue what this means in terms of browsers (technical details, obviously, are absent). And no, I have no idea what Intel was doing in the mobile OS world, either. Maybe this merger was the point. (Whose chipsets will the new MeeGo devices use?)</p>
<p>For now I assume that the Gecko-based MicroB browser will remain the default one of the new system, and that Mozilla will create a Firefox port for it. That’s just guesswork, though.</p>
<p>The most interesting tidbit is that the new MeeGo platform is not restricted to Nokia; <a href="http://www.liliputing.com/2010/02/lg-gw990-smartphone-to-run-meego-linux.html" class="external">LG just announced</a> it will release a MeeGo phone. It was already working with Moblin, anyway, so moving to the new platform wouldn’t be such a huge step.</p>
<p>I hope the photo in the article does not depict LG’s new phone, though. The photo shows the Obigo browser, and if there’s one browser you should definitely avoid if you want to give your users a forward-looking browsing experience it’s Obigo.</p>
<p>That concludes my coverage of the MWC news. If you have more mobile browser news, please leave a link in the comments.</p>

<p>Some clarification seems to be in order about the Adobe and HTML5 debacle. What happened is that one public resource indicates that Larry Masinter (from Adobe) raised a Formal Objection and another indicates he objects and wonders how he can do that formally. Several private resources reveal more, but they cannot be discussed. The objection is against publication of HTML+RDFa, HTML Microdata, and HTML Canvas 2D Context, on the grounds that these would not be in scope. The public resources are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/2010/02/11-html-wg-minutes.html#item07" title="Update on publishing new drafts">HTML Weekly Teleconference</a>. For those not familiar with the abbreviations, FO is the abbreviation for Formal Objection, FPWD means First Public Working Draft, <i>paulc</i> and <i>rubys</i> are co-chairs of the HTML WG, and <i>plh</i> is the W3C Interaction Domain Activity Lead, of which the HTML WG is part.</li>
<li><a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2010Feb/0002.html" title="Documents not in scope for HTML-WG">An email to www-archive</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The objection to HTML Canvas 2D Context is spurious in particular since it has been part of the W3C draft of HTML5 since the very beginning. The scope question for that API has been raised two years ago and was resolved back then, involving all the layers of W3C, <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2010Feb/0005.html" title="Re: Documents not in scope for HTML-WG">including its Director</a>. That it is now decided to publish it is a separate document does not change the resolution of this decision on scope. HTML Microdata has likewise been published as part of HTML5 by the W3C before. HTML+RDFa is a new more recent effort and has never been part of the HTML5 draft.</p>
<p>The situation at this point is somewhat confusing with Larry <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Feb/0365.html" title="RE: clarification on Adobe Blocking">claiming</a> he did not raise a Formal Objection (though not disputing he is objecting, using &quot;Formal&quot;), <i>plh</i> <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/2010/02/working_group_publication_requ.html" title="Working Group Publication Requests and Approval">talking about</a> procedural questions in a blog post, and the co-chairs of the HTML WG providing a bunch of pointers in comments on <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2010/Feb/16/html5/">Some questions about the “blocking” of HTML5</a>, but not much else.</p>
<p>Today is the last day of the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Feb/0262.html" title="CfC: Publish HTML5, RDFa heartbeats and Microdata, 2D Context and H:TML as FPWDs">call for consensus</a> to publish the drafts. I guess we will see where it all stands tomorrow.</p>

		<p>My grandfather, who unfortunately has been dead for several years, was a man fond of four-letter words to express his sentiments. Once a Navy sailor and a lumberjack, he’d adopted to a picturesque family life a little late in his years. Imagine a charming, smiling old fellow who’d be wearing a nice suit and tie as he shook your hand, then you’d notice “Lloyd” was tattooed on his knuckles. (Hidden under the nice suit was a much larger tattoo of a giant patriotic eagle on his chest.) Midway through a church picnic, he might let slip some colorful language during a tale.</p>
<p>My grandmother did her best to correct his language. One word she’d like to encourage him to use instead was “hooey.”</p>
<p><a title="Link to CSSquirrel #54: Larry Ate HTML5" href="http://www.cssquirrel.com/comic/?comic=54">Today’s comic</a> features hooey. It also features <a title="Link to Ian Hickson" href="http://ln.hixie.ch/" target="_blank">Ian “the Leviathan” Hickson</a>, Google employee and HTML5 editor-for-life (nowadays, he’s more of a generic HTML editor-for-life, which is likely a much sweeter gig) as well as <a title="Link to Larry Masinter" href="http://larry.masinter.net/" target="_blank">Larry Masinter</a>, Principle Scientist at Adobe.</p>
<p>The hooey in the comic is hyperbole for the effect of comedy; Ian has not outed Larry as a cannibal.</p>
<p>However, Ian did perform some character assassination last Friday when he fired off <a title="Link to Consistency by Ian Hickson" href="http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1265967771&amp;count=1" target="_blank">this blog pos</a>t accusing Adobe of “blocking” HTML5. He also took the opportunity to simultaneously claim he couldn’t reveal the author of a post for it being in a private list (he chose to use the word “secret”, likely for dramatic effect) while immediately revealing the author’s identity in the very following paragraph (which in this case was Larry.)</p>
<p>There’s a few issues here that point at the continuing mire that is the political process of HTML5, and the resulting decrease in public confidence in the resulting product. First, we’ll look at Ian’s charge: that somehow Adobe is blocking HTML5. This is an absurd statement from Hixie, who’s made it clear that the <a title="Link to WHATWG" href="http://whatwg.org/" target="_blank">WHATWG</a> controls HTML5 (in his view) and not the <a title="Link to the W3C" href="http://w3c.org/" target="_blank">W3C</a>. So for him to claim that a W3C action is impacting the adoption of a spec he adamantly states is in WHATWG’s hand is like saying that the mayor of Osaka, Japan is blocking the Washington state budget from being passed. It’s an act of dishonesty at worst, or emotional manipulation of his readership at best.</p>
<p>(I am not saying the W3C doesn’t have a leadership role in the HTML5 effort. Rather, I’m saying that according to many prior statements by Ian, it doesn’t.)</p>
<p>Regardless, several people caught this “story” and ran with it. Perhaps it’s the Apple/Adobe conflict spawning fanboys and lines drawn in the sand, but a lot of people are willing to demonize Adobe at the drop of a hat. So, rapidly, the word was tweeted throughout the digital realms: Adobe hates HTML. And kicks babies.</p>
<p>I wonder how many of those re-tweeters use Photoshop, Illustrator or Dreamweaver on a regular basis?</p>
<p>Fortunately, some non-partisan cowboys came riding into town and cleared the air with a thoughtful examination on the situation. In particular, I recommend reading <a title="Link to Simon St. Laurent's O'Reilly profile" href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/166" target="_blank">Simon St. Laurent’s</a> <a title="Link to The Widening HTML5 Chasm by Simon St. Laurent" href="http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2010/02/the-widening-html5-chasm.html" target="_blank">The Widening HTML5 Chasm</a> and <a title="Link to OS News' profile on Thom Holwerda" href="http://www.osnews.com/user/uid:5/" target="_blank">Thom Holwerda’s</a> <a title="Link to Teacup, Meet Storm, part IV" href="http://www.osnews.com/story/22874/Teacup_Meet_Storm_pt_IV_Adobe_Blocking_HTML5_/" target="_blank">Teacup, Meet Storm, part IV</a>. Please take the opportunity to peruse their posts for some perspective. Once you’ve received that enlightenment, continue.</p>
<p>Done? Ok. Onwards, then.</p>
<p>Ian Hickson is a Google employee. Which means he’s a smart man. His track record of work speaks to that effect, and it’s worth saying that despite my disagreements with his process, much of HTML5’s good parts have appeared thanks to his efforts as the spec’s editor.</p>
<p>Ian Hickson has a methodology for handling people. It’s documented at his website <a title="Link to Ian Hickson's Bible on Handling People" href="http://ian.hixie.ch/bible/handling-people" target="_blank">here</a>. One section on discrediting has some lovely gems that seem to apply to the situation: “<em>Discredit the man who produced the report, off the record.</em>” and “<em>Say that he is harbouring a grudge against your group.</em>”</p>
<p>Also, I’m going to propose that our dear <a title="Link to Behold Leviathan, Confused" href="http://www.cssquirrel.com/2009/08/03/behold-leviathan-confused/">Leviathan</a> has been working on HTML5 for quite some time, and as such has been up to his eyeballs in the process for years. He knows how the process works, clearly, and has historically shown his willingness to ignore said process if that gave him the opportunity to do what he preferred over what the majority desired. (That’s also in his book on handling people: <em>If you don’t agree with a rule you are told to follow, announce your agreement to it in a statement, and in that statement, assert that you intend to follow it in a manner consistent with some other set of rules; or that you will consider certain passages as merely being “advisory”</em>.)</p>
<p>So he’s smart, follows a personal methodology of handling people that involves discrediting them, and he’s familiar with the W3C process. Right?</p>
<p>Very well then. Let me say it: Ian’s insinuations about Adobe were, as my grandmother would say, hooey. Intentional hooey. My grandfather would have used a stronger term. Ian deliberately publicized the identity of someone who posted in a private mailing list (immediately after claiming he could not). He used words like “secret” to provide a sense of conspiracy. He used Adobe as a scape-goat so that we’d all see that HTML5 was being blocked by W3C processes (despite his insistence that the W3C has nothing to do with the actual invention and progression of HTML5).</p>
<p>This is the man who doesn’t like HTML5 politics? This is the man who will be controlling <span class="c1">HTML5</span> all versions of HTML for the remainder of his life?</p>
<p>Well, that’s just splendid.</p>

		<p class="preamble">Email messages often contain a number of questions that the sender wants the recipient to answer. I find that many responses to such messages are much more difficult to understand than they should be. Not because of grammar or spelling errors, but because of how the responses are structured and formatted.</p>
<p>I’d like to share two tips that, in my opinion, will make responses to multiple question messages much easier and quicker to read.</p>

		<p class="preamble">When an image specified with an <code>img</code> element is missing from a web page, some browsers display the alt text instead. Why not all browsers do that is a separate topic which I talk a bit about in <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200912/safari_webkit_and_alt_text_for_missing_images/">Safari, WebKit and alt text for missing images</a>.</p>
<p>I think most people will agree that it is a good thing for web browsers to display the contents of an image’s <code>alt</code> attribute when the image is missing or broken, or image rendering has been disabled. However, many web professionals forget to check what the alternative text will actually look like in those cases.</p>

		<p>Since we are living in the Year of Our Lord Twenty-Ten, <a title="Link to CSSquirrel #53: Mr. Flash's Very Bad Day" href="http://www.cssquirrel.com/comic/?comic=53">today’s comic</a> is so far behind the news cycle that I might as well be discussing the <a title="Link to the Wars of the Roses on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_the_Roses" target="_blank">Wars of the Roses</a> if I’m trying to be relevant to current events. Starring <a title="Link to Adobe Flash" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/" target="_blank">Adobe Flash</a> and the <a title="Link to the Apple iPad" href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/" target="_blank">Apple iPad</a>, my illustration references a product announced an entire thirteen days in the past (gasp!).</p>
<p>If you can remember that far back into the past, you might recall that the iPad is something to the effect of an iPod Touch nega-Mini, being simultaneously some sort of multimedia super-nexus and entirely incapable of fitting into your pocket. I’m not sure yet if I have a need for a device guaranteed to break my neck while I try to watch <del>adult</del> action films on it. But I’m sure at this point that the iPad has for all extents and purposes killed Adobe Flash.</p>
<p>Right? I’m sure I read that in the Wall Street Journal somewhere.</p>
<p>No? My bad.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Flash shares that quality with Mark Twain wherein the reports of its death are doubtlessly greatly exaggerated. It remains to be seen if the iPad will sell like hotcakes (my bet: it will) but even if it does some people might have forgotten about these little devices we have around the house called desktop and laptop computers.</p>
<p>Remember those?</p>
<p>Well, they still have browsers that can install the Flash plug-in. And if the immortality that Internet Explorer 6 is experiencing is any guide, there’s no reason to believe that Flash is going anywhere anytime soon. Plenty of cartoons, online video, and video games are still being churned out onto the web via Flash.</p>
<p>I’m debating if that’s a pity or not.</p>
<p>When I first started tinkering on the web as a programming platform, my initial tenuous steps into interactive nonsense was with Flash. Over time, the shine of it dulled, and I found my way to the wonders of JavaScript. Thanks to the envelope-pushing features of HTML5, much of what once required Flash is now quite doable with no plug-in. But there are some tasks, including complicated animation, wherein Flash is still the idea authoring tool. I can’t help but feel sorry for the likes of the Brothers Chaps, who’ve toiled over products like <a title="Link to Homestar Runner" href="http://homestarrunner.com/" target="_blank">Homestar Runner</a>, only to have it not render on the coolest mobile devices since the portable toaster.</p>
<p>I’d rather not have a situation where a given browser decides for me what content I will or won’t view on the Internet. As a consenting adult, I’m pretty sure I have the decision-making power to do that myself. However, the fact is, Apple has made that decision, and likely won’t back down from it, and more devices like the iPad will continue the trend.</p>
<p>If I were Adobe, I’d be looking into how to transition the Flash authoring tool from something that outputs only SWF files into something that produces pre-generated Canvas/JS/CSS code. A sort of interactive Dreamweaver on steroids. That would allow the thousands of developers that use it to painlessly transition into a post-plugin era while still making use of their tool of choice.</p>
<p>Of course, until either Adobe cries uncle or all browsers get on the same page in regards to HTML5 feature adoption (like which video codec to use), all that devices like the iPad are doing for me personally is creating a situation where I have to stuff even more code into the same video on a page; if I want my clients’ videos to show on all available browsers and devices, that is.</p>
<p>That said, I’m not really attached to Flash. If I can get my videos and other rich content without it, then good riddance. Which is, allegedly, what the iPad’s move is leading us towards (or, more cynically, towards iTunes purchases of video content).</p>

		<p>Since my attempts at capturing web developers’ hearts and minds by <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/02/persistent_touc.html">publishing</a> <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/02/the_touch_actio.html">fundamental</a> <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/02/do_we_need_touc.html">research</a> have failed miserably but my thirst for attention continues unabated, today I will once more shout at iPhone developers. That’s <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/11/apple_is_not_ev.html">proven to work</a>.</p>
<p>More specifically, today I will shout at web developers who think that delicately inserting an iPhone up their ass is the same as mobile web development.</p>
<p>Before we start, a little thought experiment. Suppose I proposed the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>IE6 is today’s most advanced browser. (<strong>Note</strong>: this was actually true back in 2000. Please bear with me.)</li>
<li>IE6’s market share is about 80%.</li>
<li>The other browsers are way worse than IE6, and developing for them is a pain; something we’re not interested in and are a bit afraid of.</li>
<li>Therefore we will develop websites exclusively for IE6.</li>
</ol>
<p>Would you agree with those sentiments, even if we’re back in 2000 and IE6 is <em>really</em> the best browser we have?</p>
<p>Or would you reply that our sites should work as well as they can in all browsers through the use of web standards, progressive enhancement, and all the rest of the best practices we’ve been preaching for the past ten years?</p>
<p>I distinctly remember a time when we web developers cared about such concepts. But those times are long gone.</p>
<h3>Warning! iCandy will damage your brain!</h3>
<p>Nowadays we live in a fantasy world that focuses exclusively on one platform, and does so exclusively for reasons of eye candy.</p>
<p>We laughingly disown every single principle the web standards movement has ever stood for in the past ten years in order to swoon and drool over Apple’s iCandy and happily accept the reality distortion field that emanates from it.</p>
<p>The iPhone has become an obsession. If we don’t pay attention, we’ll have a mobile web that only works on the iPhone. And then we’ll have the <em>real</em> mobile web that wasn’t made by us and doesn’t give a shit about web standards and best practices.</p>
<p>Worse, it seems web developers are happy with this state of affairs. It seems web developers are <em>congratulating themselves</em> on excluding 85% of the smartphone users. They certainly never bother to check their sites in S60 WebKit, the largest smartphone browser in the world.</p>
<p>Fucking dimwits.</p>
<p>We’re doing exactly the same as ten years ago. We now say “iPhone” instead of “IE6,” but otherwise nothing’s changed.</p>
<p>No, wait, there’s one more change: the iPhone has <em>far less</em> mobile market share now than IE6 had desktop share back then.</p>
<h3>Stats</h3>
<p>Let’s illustrate that last remark with some <a href="http://communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/2010/02/phone-market-shares-for-year-of-2009-and-last-quarter-2009.html" class="external">smartphone sales</a> stats:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nokia: 39%</li>
<li>RIM: 20% <span class="smaller">(BlackBerry)</span></li>
<li>Apple: 15% <span class="smaller">(this 15% is obviously <em>far</em> more important than the previous 59%)</span></li>
<li>HTC: 5%</li>
<li>Other: 21% <span class="smaller">(Samsung is expected to make a major jump this year)</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="floater smaller nolines">
<p>Let’s break these sales stats down by continent. Asia excluding Japan first:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nokia: 75%</li>
<li>Apple: 8%</li>
<li>HTC: 6%</li>
<li>RIM: 4%</li>
<li>Samsung: 3%</li>
<li>Motorola: 2%</li>
</ol>
<p>Western Europe:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nokia: 48%</li>
<li>Apple: 20%</li>
<li>RIM: 15%</li>
<li>HTC: 10%</li>
<li>Samsung: 5%</li>
<li>SonyEricsson: 1%</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally North America:</p>
<ol>
<li>RIM: 51%</li>
<li>Apple: 29%</li>
<li>HTC: 6%</li>
<li>Palm: 5% (probably includes PalmOS devices)</li>
<li>Nokia: 4%</li>
<li>Samsung: 2%</li>
<li>Sharp: 1%</li>
</ol>
<p>Apple is second in every market, but the <em>least</em> difference with the market leader is 22% in North America.</p>

<p>North Americans are parochial in their choice of a smartphone. One more reason why the North American market has zero predictive value for the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Oddly, Europeans buy relatively more Asian smartphones, while Asians buy relatively more European smartphones.</p>
<p>The Japanese market is so very different from all the others that I left it out. Besides, a full 20% of Japanese smartphone sales fall in an unspecified “others” category. Apple is fourth with 10% of sales.</p>
<p>The Japanese are even more parochial than the Americans when it comes to selecting a smartphone, but that’s partly caused by the unique shape the mobile space has in that country. None of the Western manufacturers has truly created an inroad in the most advanced mobile market in the world.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the Japanese market <em>does</em> have predictive value for the rest of the world, but it’s sometimes <em>so</em> advanced that it’s hard to understand.</p>
</div>
<p>And here are the smartphone OS stats, also from Tomi Ahonen (whose <a href="http://communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/" class="external">blog</a> I highly recommend, by the way):</p>
<ol>
<li>Symbian: 45% <span class="smaller">(all of Nokia plus a bit of SonyEricsson and Samsung)</span></li>
<li>BlackBerry: 20%</li>
<li>iPhone: 15% <span class="smaller">(this 15% is obviously <em>far</em> more important than the previous 65%)</span></li>
<li>Windows Mobile: 6% <span class="smaller">(HTC, Samsung, SonyEricsson)</span></li>
<li>Android: 4% <span class="smaller">(HTC, Samsung, SonyEricsson, Motorola, Google)</span></li>
<li>Other: 10% <span class="smaller">(Various Linux builds, Palm, as well as really obscure stuff. Will be reinforced by Samsung Bada during this year.)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Despite the platform having only 15% sales market share we all want our mobile websites to look exactly like an iPhone app and we only want to use iPhone features.</p>
<p>We want to happily live forever in our fantasy world that’s filled to overflowing with fucking iPhones, and where Nokias or BlackBerries aren’t welcome. Our rationalisation machine is running overtime to maintain this illusion and filter away reality.</p>
<p>We’re a bunch of lousy amateurs, that’s what we are.</p>
<p>No “mobile web development” specialist ever mentions Nokia ever. After all, Nokia only sells more smartphones than BlackBerry and Apple combined, so there’s no reason to mention it.</p>
<p>Mentioning Nokia is the mark of the rude boor. The man of discernment mentions the iPhone. And mentions it and mentions it and mentions it. And then mentions the iPad, to show he is open to non-iPhone devices. The bigger the better.</p>
<p>Oh, and don’t bring up Android. Yes, it’s an excellent system, and yes, it could have a bright future ahead of it, but right now it doesn’t amount to anything in the global market. It certainly won’t serve as a “Hey, I do multiple platforms” alibi.</p>
<p>15% + 4% = 19%</p>
<p>Turn off the fucking reality distortion field.</p>
<h3>Arguments</h3>
<p>“But ... but ... ” I hear you sputter. Sputter on. You’re wrong.</p>
<h4>UX</h4>
<p class="but">But the iPhone has the best user experience of any phone!</p>
<p>True. So what?</p>
<p>Whole flocks of web developers swear that their Mac is far more user-friendly than any Windows machine that will ever be invented. Still, do they develop websites only for Macs?</p>
<h4>Safari</h4>
<p class="but">But Safari iPhone is the best mobile browser!</p>
<p>True. So what?</p>
<p>Firefox is the best desktop browser. (Or Opera, or Safari, or whatever.) Do you develop sites exclusively for Firefox?</p>
<h4>CSS enhancements</h4>
<p class="but">But Safari supports amazing CSS-driven graphic capabilities!</p>
<p>True. So what?</p>
<p>Use these capabilities, by all means. Just don’t depend on them. Don’t stare at them obsessively for hours on end and then decide you’ve made your site “mobile compatible.”</p>
<p>There’s this thing called progressive enhancement. It’s a neat trick that allows you to use the iPhone’s capabilities without damaging the experience of users of other phones.</p>
<h4>Traffic market share</h4>
<p class="but">But Safari iPhone has about 50% of mobile internet traffic market share! You can’t ignore that, can you?</p>
<p>Watch me ignore it.</p>
<p>First, so what? No, let me rephrase that: So <em>fucking</em> what? Since when does web development mean leaving 50% of your mobile users out in the cold? Since when is “I only support browsers with a large market share” a valid argument? (Answer: since we have an iPhone up our ass.)</p>
<p>Next, I’m not so sure if it’s true. Mobile browser detection is really hard. None of the reports I’ve read so far show <em>how</em> they detect browsers. Lots of mobile browsers have <code>iPhone</code> in their UA strings to work around browser detects that obsessed web developers have set up. Do all traffic market share reporters work around that problem? Most probably do, but we can’t be sure.</p>
<p>Besides, what will happen when the operators abandon the economically untenable flat rate for iPhone data traffic? Will iPhone users maintain their current traffic market share when they have to pay as they go?</p>
<h4>US doesn’t matter</h4>
<p>Next, many market share reports apply only to the US market, and it’s exactly these reports that are discussed most by the influential American tech bloggers.</p>
<p>The real mobile battle, however, will take place in Europe and Asia. The US is a sideshow. Unfortunately it’s extraordinarily hard to convince people, both Americans and non-Americans, of that fact. So let’s try again:</p>
<p>Contrary to every single other technical advance of the last 50 years, mobile did not start in the US, and the US has always been somewhat behind Asia and Europe. For instance, SMS only <em>really</em> took off with the Obama campaign, while the rest of the world became addicted to it years ago.</p>
<div class="floater smaller">
<p>Source: <a href="http://www.morganstanley.com/institutional/techresearch/pdfs/mobile_internet_report.pdf" class="external">Morgan Stanley Mobile Internet Report</a> (48Meg PDF) p. 75</p>
</div>
<p>While North America has 17% of the world’s internet users, it has only 7% of the world’s mobile users. Europe (22%) and Asia (45%) have the same figure for both.</p>
<p>The US market doesn’t have any predictive value for the rest of the world, either, because Nokia is absent. It’s just a small niche market.</p>
<p>That means that, contrary to every other branch of tech, American mobile opinions just aren’t very important to the rest of the world. For the American market, yes, of course they matter. For all other markets, don’t listen to them.</p>
<p>The problem is that too much of the rest of the world takes its cues from the well-read US tech bloggers that have made obsessing over Apple and Google while being blissfully unaware of the rest of the mobile ecosystem into a fine art.</p>
<p>In the medium run the problem will solve itself. Either the US bloggers will catch up with mobile reality, or they will cease to be read. I’m guessing the former. They’re not stupid.</p>
<h4>Our fault</h4>
<p>But with all that said I still have no reliable traffic market share figures. So let’s accept that 50% of all mobile web traffic comes from the iPhone. Or 30%. Or 70%. Whatever. Far more than its sales market share, in any case.</p>
<p>Point is, <em>that’s our fault</em>.</p>
<p>I can vividly imagine an S60 WebKit user getting tired of shitty websites whose developers were too busy playing with their iPhones to bother with the largest worldwide smartphone browser.</p>
<p>We web developers are doing an <em>amazingly</em> lousy job right now. We have to start serious mobile testing instead of just playing around with our iPhone for a few minutes before declaring our site fit for mobile.</p>
<p>Supporting all browsers is the <em>whole fucking point</em> of being a good web developer, and I’m going to force you to do it even if I have to personally swear at each of you individually.</p>
<h3>Remove iPhone from ass</h3>
<p>I’m sick of the travesty that calls itself “mobile web development” but mostly amounts to Apple-obsessed idiots with iPhones so far up their asses that their brains are starving for oxygen.</p>
<p>Do you <em>ever</em> see any mainstream mobile web development article that talks about S60 WebKit or the (lousy) BlackBerry browser? Due to our iPhone obsession we are deliberately not paying any attention to a user group that’s four times as large as the iPhone.</p>
<p>We have come full-circle back to developing for only one browser. Worse, we are congratulating ourselves on that bit of cleverness. Christ, do we <em>really</em> have to go through the whole standards movement <em>once again?</em></p>
<p>True, the default browsers on Nokia and (especially) BlackBerry phones are less advanced than Safari iPhone, but so what? Dealing with them is the job we signed up to do. Besides, Nokia and BlackBerry are fully aware of the situation, and I expect significant improvements during this year. And if not, there’s always Opera.</p>
<p>As to traffic, Nokias and BlackBerries may consume less that their fair share, but as I said earlier <em>that’s our fault</em>. We can’t use the mess we created as an excuse to create an even larger mess. Besides, which web developer ignores 85% of his potential users? (The answer, obviously, is: one with an iPhone up his ass.)</p>
<h3>Work to do</h3>
<p>Web developers should take a look at their sites on a Nokia and a BlackBerry and fix whatever’s wrong. It isn’t <em>that</em> hard to get your hands on a testing device. Just ask around or use <a href="http://perfectomobile.com" class="external">PerfectoMobile</a>. (I do not trust emulators, so I don’t recommend their use.)</p>
<p>Install Opera Mini on the device, and also install Opera Mobile if you have a Nokia. Check in both. The native browsers are more important, though.</p>
<p>Oh, and remember: Fixing a site for a browser does <em>not</em> mean making sure the complete feature set works in that browser. Use progressive enhancement. Lots and lots of it. Especially on BlackBerry. That’ll keep you sane.</p>
<p>Finally, I’ll be monitoring new mobile web publications, and I’m thinking of instating an “iPhone Up Ass Award” for the mobile web development article that ignores reality most effectively. You have been warned.</p>
<p>If you write an article about mobile web development, I expect you to devote a significant chunk of it to one or two specific Nokia or BlackBerry phones. Show you can look further than just the latest fad and see the mobile web in its entirety.</p>
<p>To those who <em>still</em> want to blather about seamless UX and swoonworthy CSS and all the rest of the bullshit: why don’t you fuck the fuck off and go wank your stupid iThingy elsewhere? If you’re not interested in universal access you’re not a real web developer and you don’t belong on the mobile web.</p>
<p>As for the rest of us, we’ve got work to do.</p>

<p>Last month I was in the Argentinian part of Patagonia on vacation. While in Ushuaia Arjan and I partook in a one-day trip to see penguins. The penguins were living on a small island that is part of a larger set of land that was once given by the Argentina government to a British settler. The government did this because they were afraid that Chile would claim their part of Tierra del Fuego if it was uninhabited. And since the settler was planning on going home giving him lots of land that nobody was using anyway was presumably thought as an easy way to keep him around. (He and now his descendants cannot ever sell the land under the agreement.) At some point a large batch of penguins settled on this land and his descendants now earn a lot of tourist money with them. Given that their main source of income used to be cattle and that most of the cattle died in an extreme winter, I guess they are lucky!</p>

		<p>One reaction I received about my <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/02/the_touch_actio.html">touch research</a> was: Do we really need the touch events? Can’t we just fire the mouse events when a touch action occurs? After all, touch and mouse events aren’t <em>that</em> different.</p>
<p>That’s a fair question. It deserves a fair answer.</p>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>Right now, iPhone and Android support the touchstart, touchmove, and touchend events. Let’s say my <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/browsers/touch.html">advice</a> is accepted and future browsers also support the touchenter, touchleave, and touchhold events.</p>
<p>The point here is that this series of events isn’t that different from the mouse events. Respectively, mousedown, mousemove, mouseup, mouseover, and mouseout fulfill the same role as the first five touch events. The touchhold event does not have a direct mouse equivalent, but it basically fulfills the same function as a right-click detection script.</p>
<p>So if mousedown is really the same as touchstart, why bother with new events? Can’t we just write a mousedown script that is triggered when the user depresses his mouse button OR touches the screen?</p>
<h3>The issues</h3>
<p>As far as I can see there are three fundamental issues involved:</p>
<ol>
<li>Touch interaction is different from mouse interaction. Not hugely different, but different enough to warrant separate events.</li>
<li>It MUST be possible to write ONE single JavaScript file that works optimally in any circumstances, on the desktop, in a mobile browser, or in a widget manager, with the user using the touchscreen, the mouse, or the keyboard, as he sees fit. That implies the web developer MUST be able to distinguish between mouse-driven and touch-driven interaction.</li>
<li>The mouse events have already been implemented as legacy events in all touchscreen browsers. They all fire after the user releases the screen.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s study these issues a bit further.</p>
<h4>Issue 1: difference</h4>
<p>Although at first sight it seems as it touchstart is equal to mousedown, touchmove to mousemove, and touchend to mouseup, this is not really the case.</p>
<p>Take a look at my <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/m/tests/scrollayer2.html">second scrolling layer script</a>. It was written for touchscreen phones, and works perfectly if the browser supports the touch events. Currently only iPhone and Android do.</p>
<p>I added the mousedown event to touchdown, mousemove to touchmove, and mouseup to touchup. Try it in a normal desktop browser. You’ll find that, although the script works, the interaction just doesn’t make sense. The mouse events aren’t <em>quite</em> the same as the touch events, even though they’re pretty similar.</p>
<p>For more fun, try using it with a touchpad.</p>
<p>If you <em>really</em> want to have fun, try the script on a Nokia S60v3 device, which has a pseudo-cursor and implements the mouse events exactly like desktop browsers. The script works ... in a way.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong> to UX experts: how <em>should</em> the scrolling layer work when the user has a mouse?</p>
<p>In other words, we need a different interaction model for desktop browsers. That requires us to first make a distinction between mouse-driven and touch-driven browsers. But how?</p>
<h4>Issue 2: one file</h4>
<p>There’s one extra requirement: I absolutely want to be able to deliver one single JavaScript file that contains all the scripts necessary for all interactions. And obviously I do not want to use a browser detect at all in order to determine whether a certain browser needs the mouse or the touch version.</p>
<p>So how do we distinguish between the two? Simple: see if a touchstart event fires. If it does, the browser is certain to be a touchscreen device and we should disable the mouse events.</p>
<p>It would work something like this:</p>
<pre>
var testEl = [the element you want to do something with];
testEl.onmousedown = function () {
        // initialize mouse interface
}
testEl.ontouchstart = function () {
        <strong>testEl.onmousedown = null;</strong>
        // initialize touch interface
}
</pre>
<p>This works fine. The touchstart event fires before the mousedown event, and therefore we can wipe the mousedown event handler before it’s ever executed.</p>
<p>A really proper script would have a third interaction model for using the keyboard. I haven’t written that yet because it’s somewhat more tricky than the touch/mouse one. I will have to deal with S60v3, where the “arrow” keys guide a pseudo mouse cursor across the screen and both the mouse and the key events fire. Besides, the user may alternate between the keyboard and either a mouse or a touchscreen.</p>
<p>Still, we can use a similar trick here: we know that the user is using a mouse if the mousemove event is detected. More specifically, if <em>two</em> mousemove events are detected within a short period of time. After all, all mobile touchscreen browsers will fire one (and only one) mousemove event when the user releases the screen, and that does <em>not</em> constitute evidence for a mouse-based interface.</p>
<p>Of course we can only distinguish them if keyboard use fires different events than mouse use. As we know it does: the keydown, keypress, and keyup events have long been supported by all browsers. Imagine a browser in which depressing a key would fire a <em>mousedown</em> event!</p>
<p>This sort of distinguishing between different interaction models is only possible if the three models use different events. If the touch actions would also use the mouse events, it would be impossible to distinguish between the two.</p>
<h4>Issue 3: prior art</h4>
<p>Finally, let’s repeat it once more, <em>all touchscreen browsers</em> (with the sole exception of the two Vodafone Widget Managers) already fire <em>all</em> mouse events in one long cascade when the user releases the screen.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t require all browsers to change this behaviour. First of all it doesn’t make sense, and secondly they won’t all do it, leaving us stuck with an impossible situation where some browsers support the mouse events as if they’re a desktop browser, and others as if they’re a touch browser. That’s a recipe for disaster.</p>
<h3>Separate touch events</h3>
<p>So I strongly believe that all mobile touchscreen browsers MUST (in the sense of RFC 2119) support separate touchstart, touchmove, and touchend events and relegate the mouse events to legacy status.</p>
<p>Web developers will benefit from this since they can easily distinguish between the various interaction modes and create scripts that are suited to every one of them.</p>

		<p class="preamble">Anyone who has been using CSS for any length of time has probably been frustrated by the lack of selector support in Internet Explorer 6. There are quite a lot of cases where a CSS 2.1 selector will let you target elements in all other relevant browsers, but where you, if you want it to work in IE 6, have to add a class or id attribute to the HTML.</p>
<p>Well, the market share of IE 6 is now <strong>finally</strong> at a level where we as developers can say that a site “supporting” IE 6 does not necessarily mean “looking pixel perfect”. Fortunately more and more clients understand this as well. IE 7 has been out for well over three years and IE 9 is on the horizon, so I think it’s time to revive those CSS selectors that you never got to use just because IE 6 doesn’t understand them.</p>

		<p>It turns out to be possible to handle the touchmove and touchend events with data obtained from the touchstart event object. It is not necessary to access the touchmove and touchend event objects, as long as you continue to have access to the touchstart one.</p>
<p>Apparently, the touchstart event object persists in browser memory even when the event has long ended. More importantly, it continues to be updated with information about the current touch action.</p>
<p>This is interesting. It’s also profoundly different from the desktop, where a similar trick with the mousedown, mousemove, and mouseup events definitely does <em>not</em> work.</p>
<p>Both iPhone and Android display this behaviour. Therefore future implementations of the touch events should, too.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2008/07/10/touching-and-gesturing-on-the-iphone/" class="external">Touching and Gesturing on the iPhone</a> for more information on how the touch events work on the iPhone.</p>
<h3>An error</h3>
<p>While tinkering with my <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/m/tests/scrollayer.html">scrolling layer</a> test page I found out that I’d made an error in the first version. Oddly, this first version worked absolutely fine on both iPhone and Android; that’s why I didn’t notice the error at first.</p>
<p>I just plain forgot to give the <code>e</code> argument to the touchend function. The script got its touchend information from the touchstart event object:</p>
<pre>
var testEl = [the scrolling layer];

testEl.ontouchstart = function (<strong>e</strong>) {
        // do stuff
        var origin = getCoors(e);
        testEl.ontouchmove = moveDrag;
        testEl.ontouchend = function () { &lt;-- forgot the e
                var end = getCoors(<strong>e</strong>);    &lt;-- e is touchstart object
                // do stuff
                testEl.ontouchmove = testEl.ontouchend = null;
        }

        function moveDrag(e) {
                var currentPos = getCoors(e);
                // move layer
        }

        function getCoors(e) {
                var coors;
                if (e.touches &amp;&amp; e.touches.length) {    // iPhone
                        coors = e.touches[0].clientX;
                } else {                                // all others
                        coors = e.clientX;
                }
                return coors;
        }
}
</pre>
<p>I found the error because I wanted to make the script <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/m/tests/scrollayer2.html">desktop-compatible</a> in order to prove that from an interaction point of view it makes no sense to just swap the mouse events in place for the touch events.</p>
<p>I added mousedown, mousemove, and mouseup event handlers, saw an abrupt stop in Firefox instead of the smooth stop, and discovered the missing <code>e</code>. Incidentally, this proves that the mouse events do not have persistent event objects (something we’ve known for 10 years, but still).</p>
<h3>Using one touch object</h3>
<p>My curiosity played up. Apparently, handling the touchend event with information obtained from the touchstart event object works fine. Could I rewrite the script so that it <em>only</em> uses the touchstart event object, and entirely ignores the touchmove and touchend objects?</p>
<p>The answer turns out to be Yes. The <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/m/tests/scrollayer3.html">following script</a> works fine on iPhone and Android:</p>
<pre>
var testEl = [the scrolling layer];

testEl.ontouchstart = function (<strong>e</strong>) {
        // do stuff
        var origin = getCoors();
        testEl.ontouchmove = moveDrag;
        testEl.ontouchend = function () {
                var end = getCoors();
                // do stuff
                testEl.ontouchmove = testEl.ontouchend = null;
                setTimeout(checkOneLastTime,1000);
        }

        function moveDrag() {
                var currentPos = getCoors();
                // move layer
        }

        function getCoors() {

                // e refers to the touchstart event object
                // even if the getCoors function is called
                // ontouchmove or ontouchend. Works fine

                var coors;
                if (<strong>e</strong>.touches) {                       // iPhone
                        coors = <strong>e</strong>.touches[0].clientX;
                } else {                                // all others
                        coors = <strong>e</strong>.clientX;
                }
                return coors;
        }

        function checkOneLastTime() {
                alert(getCoors())       // works! event object still there
        }
}
</pre>
<p>In other words, the original touchstart event object persists even when the touchstart event itself has long ended. Even better, it continues to be updated with new information, such as the current touch coordinates.</p>
<p>I also read out the touchstart event coordinates one second after the touchend event fired, i.e. when the entire touch action had totally and irretrievably gone. The event object was still there, although its coordinates weren’t updated any more and it ignored new touch actions.</p>
<p>I also tested whether the same is possible with the touchmove event. The answer is Yes: a similar trick that uses a touchmove event object to retrieve information about the touchend event works.</p>
<p>One could think that there is in fact only one single event object that all touchstart, touchmove, and touchend events use. This turns out not to be the case (though it’s an interesting idea).</p>
<p>When I added the missing <code>e</code> to the first version of the script it stopped working on the iPhone. The script now used the touchend event object, which did not contain the <code>touches</code> list because there were no longer any touch actions going on. I had to move to the <code>changedTouches</code> list to get the coordinates I need.</p>
<p>This proves that all events still cause unique objects to be created: the touchstart one contains a <code>touches</code> list; the touchend one doesn’t.</p>
<p>Concluding, you can easily handle the touchmove and touchend events by using the information contained in the touchstart object. There is no need to access the touchmove and touchend event objects.</p>
<p>I wonder if this has performance implications. It probably won’t; the touchmove and touchend event objects must be constructed anyway, since the browser has no way of knowing we won’t use them. (Unless you use only one single event object for an entire touch action sequence.)</p>

		<p>Over the past few weeks I have done some fundamental research into the touch action and its consequences, and it’s time to present my conclusions in the form of the <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/m/touch.html">inevitable compatibility table</a>. I have also written an <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/browsers/touch.html">advisory paper</a> that details what browser vendors must do in order to get by in the mobile touchscreen space. Finally, I discuss a few aspects of my research in this article.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure</strong>: This research was ordered and paid for by Vodafone. Nokia, Microsoft, Palm, and RIM have helped it along by donating devices to me.</p>
<p>When a user touches the screen of a touchscreen phone, sufficient events should fire so that web developers know what’s going on and can decide what actions to take. Unfortunately most mobile browsers, especially Opera and Firefox, are severely deficient here.</p>
<p>The touch action is <em>way</em> overloaded, and most browsers have trouble distinguishing between a click action and a scroll action. Properly making this distinction is the only way of creating a truly captivating mobile touchscreen browsing experience.</p>
<p>The iPhone’s touch event model is excellent and should be copied by all other browsers. In fact, these events are so important that I feel that any browser that does not support them by the end of 2010 is out of the mobile browser arms race. <del>There’s only one problem with the iPhone model, and it’s relatively easy to fix.</del></p>
<p>I have created a <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/m/tests/drag.html">drag-and-drop</a> script that works on iPhone and Android as well as the desktop browsers, a <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/m/tests/drag2.html">multitouch drag-and-drop</a> script that works only on the iPhone, and a <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/m/tests/scrollayer.html">scrolling layer</a> script that forms the basis of faking <code>position: fixed</code> on iPhone and Android, who do not support that declaration natively.</p>
<p>I will hold a presentation on my research at the <a href="http://www.dibiconference.com/" class="external">DIBI conference</a>, Newcastle upon Tyne, 28th April. It will likely include future discoveries and thoughts.</p>

<h3>Problems with the touch actions</h3>
<p>One of the most serious problems of the current touchscreen interfaces is that the touch action is <em>way way</em> overloaded. When the user touches the screen he may want to start a click action, a scroll action, or a resize action. Distinguishing correctly between these three actions is what sets a good touchscreen interface apart from a bad one.</p>
<p>This is especially important with regard to the click action. Far too often, an intended click on an element does not work because the user moves his finger a tiny little bit during the action, and the operating system concludes he wants to perform a scroll action instead. The page does not really scroll because the user does not really move his finger, but the click action is canceled, and this results in a seemingly unresponsive interface.</p>
<p>This problem is especially severe in the Samsung WebKit that runs in the Samsung H1 and M1 Widget Manager, but it occurs on other operating systems, too.</p>
<p>Only iPhone and Palm have <em>really</em> solved this problem; the other browser vendors are in various stages of catching up.</p>
<h3>Current state</h3>
<p>Events can be divided into three groups:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Touch events</strong> that describe the exact actions of the user on the screen without reference to the result of these actions. Examples: touchstart, touchmove, touchend.</li>
<li><strong>Interface events</strong> that describe the result of the touch action. Examples: click, resize, scroll, contextmenu.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy events</strong> that fire because many sites depend exclusively on them. Examples: mouseover, mousedown, mousemove, mouseup.</li>
</ol>
<p>The touch events are supported only by iPhone and Android, in that order. Even multitouch Androids do not support more than one series of touch events (i.e. more than one finger) at a time.</p>
<p>All browsers support the legacy events, although some don’t support all of them. Still, this is largely irrelevant.</p>
<p>The real chaos is in the interface event group. Most WebKit-based browsers support most events reasonably well, but all others, including Opera and Firefox, don’t support them at all or make a mess of them. That’s annoying, because it’s these events that actually tell us what the user is trying to achieve.</p>
<h4>Touch events</h4>
<p>The touch events are touchstart, touchmove, and touchend. As you’d expect the first fires once when the user initially touches the screen, the second continuously while the user is moving his finger, and the third when the user releases the screen.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2008/07/10/touching-and-gesturing-on-the-iphone/" class="external">Touching and Gesturing on the iPhone</a> for more information on how the touch events work on the iPhone. I do not repeat this background information in any of my articles.</p>
<p>All browsers MUST (in the sense of RFC 2119) support these events at their earliest opportunity. Any browser that does not support them by the end of 2010 is out of the mobile browser race.</p>
<p>The touch events are currently supported only by iPhone and Android. There are a few differences between their models:</p>
<ol>
<li>The iPhone also supports the gesture events, which fire when more than one finger touches the screen. I’m not yet totally sure how useful they will be; I’d like to see (or create) a practical test script first.</li>
<li>The iPhone stores information about the touch, notably the coordinates, in a special <code>touches</code> interface, while the Android stores them directly on the event object itself.<del>Google is right, and Apple is wrong. I explain why in my <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/browsers/touch.html">advisory paper</a>.</del></li>
</ol>
<p>There is also the touchcancel event that fires when the user’s touch is “canceled.” I haven’t yet studied it; I feel that it’s useful only in a very few edge cases.</p>
<p>The touchmove and touchend events also fire when the touch action moves out of the element where the touchstart event took place.</p>
<p>If a touch action moves into an element, touchstart generally fires. I’m wondering if we should use touchenter instead, which in turn presupposes the existence of a touchleave event.</p>
<p>I’m also wondering whether we need a touchhold event, and whether the touch events should return an <em>area</em> instead of just a coordinate of a single pixel.</p>
<h4>Interface events</h4>
<p>The interface events fire when the user actually takes an action instead of aimlessly touching the screen. These actions include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clicking on a link or otherwise activating an element. The click event should fire.</li>
<li>Scrolling. The scroll event should fire.</li>
<li>Zooming. We need a new zoom event for this situation. Currently a few browsers fire a resize event instead, but that’s not good enough, and it might be that resize should be assigned to another situation entirely. I need to do more research on this.</li>
<li>Calling up a context menu. The contextmenu event should fire. More in general we might need a touchhold event that fires when the user touches the screen and holds his finger in place, whether or not a context menu pops up. On the other hand, this event is pretty easy to fake in JavaScript.</li>
</ol>
<p>Browser compatibility is a bloody mess:</p>
<ol>
<li>The click event fires in all browsers.</li>
<li>The scroll event does not fire in Opera, Samsung WebKit, Firefox, MicroB, and NetFront when the user scrolls.</li>
<li>The zoom event does not exist yet; I’ve invented it during my research. We need it badly, though.</li>
<li>The contextmenu event does not fire when a context menu appears in Opera, Android, MicroB, or NetFront. It fires correctly on Iris and IE. The other browsers do not have a touch-based context menu.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Legacy events</h4>
<p>Current websites are created exclusively for desktop, and they use the legacy events extensively. Since mobile browsers want to give their users access to the “fixed” web, they have to support these legacy events.</p>
<p>Still, the touchscreen environment is not the same as the desktop environment. Most notably, a mouse action on the desktop is <em>not</em> equivalent to a touch action on a phone. The user of a touchscreen phone needs to touch the screen for pretty much any action (zoom, scroll, click), something that is not true for a mouse.</p>
<p>This is how the legacy events work currently:</p>
<ol>
<li>If a touchstart and a touchend action occur on (roughly) the same coordinates this constitutes a touchclick action. The legacy events are fired, as is the click event.</li>
<li>The legacy events are mouseover, mousemove, mousedown, and mouseup. The event order may differ, but that doesn’t matter. In addition the <code>:hover</code> styles, if any, are applied to the element.</li>
<li>Only one mousemove event fires.</li>
<li>When a touchclick action occurs on another element, the mouseout event is fired on the original element and the <code>:hover</code> styles are removed.</li>
<li>The dblclick event is not supported. (It’s totally useless, anyway.)</li>
<li>The Vodafone Widget Managers fire the mousedown event when the user initially touches the screen.</li>
<li>S60 Widget Manager (Opera-based) and IE try to fire continuous mousemove events.</li>
<li>Thus, the S60 Widget Manager in theory allows a mousedown/mousemove-based drag-and-drop. In practice performance is so painful that I advise you not to bother.</li>
<li>iPhone and S60 WebKit cancel the rest of the events if a DOM change occurs onmouseover or onmousemove. I’m sure this is a good idea in the short run, but the mobile space will have to emancipate itself from the “fixed web” and this rule must eventually disappear.</li>
<li>BlackBerry and NetFront do not support the mouseover and mousemove events.</li>
<li>Palm, Samsung and Firefox do not support the mousemove event.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Drag-and-drop and position: fixed</h3>
<p>In addition to the <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/m/tests/touch.html">official test page</a> I created the following tests:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/m/tests/drag.html">drag-and-drop</a> script that works on iPhone and Android in addition to the desktop browsers. The trick here is removing the mouse events when the browser turns out to support the touchstart event.</li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/m/tests/drag2.html">multitouch drag-and-drop</a> script that works only on the iPhone. Android does not support more than one finger at a time.<del>The iPhone handles the touch event properties wrongly.</del></li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/m/tests/scrollayer.html">scrolling layer</a> script that works on the iPhone and Android. <a href="http://remysharp.com/" class="external">Remy Sharp</a> pointed out that it also contains the solution to getting <code>position: fixed</code> to work on the iPhone and Android. Essentially, if you make this script vertical instead of horizontal it’ll create a scrollable layer between “fixed” panels. There are various tricky bits involved, though, and I’ll have to return to this problem later. Still, we now have the basic solution.</li>
</ol>
<h3>iPhone clickable area</h3>
<p>I suspect that on the iPhone the actual clickable area is slightly shifted downwards with regard to the visible HTML element. That is, a click just below the element may also be counted as a click on the element itself. This does not go for the area just above the element.</p>
<p>To try it for yourself, use the <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/m/tests/drag2.html">multitouch drag-and-drop</a>. Try it in normal vertical orientation first, and try to touch the element as low as possible. Then turn the device 180 degrees and try again. You’ll find that you have to touch the HTML element distinctly higher now.</p>
<p>I’m still trying to figure out how to officially prove that Apple does this; maybe I’ve misinterpreted the test results.</p>
<h3>iPhone documentation is lousy</h3>
<p>Finally, during my research I noticed time and again how unbelievably lousy Apple’s Safari iPhone documentation site is. I advise developers to use my pages instead — as usual.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is the content; once you get to the correct page you will find a terse summary of the situation that is correct as far as it goes but mostly leaves out stuff that doesn’t fall exactly in the page’s topic, even if it’s closely related.</p>
<p>Worse, the invention of the cross-reference has taken Apple completely by surprise. I wish I could say it’s scrambling to catch up, but it isn’t. No cross-references whatsoever. Anywhere.</p>
<p>Try it yourself. Go to <a href="http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariJSRef/TouchEvent/TouchEvent.html" class="external">the TouchEvent page</a>. It contains absolutely zero reference to the crucial TouchList interface that exposes useful information about the touch events. There is in fact a workable page about TouchList. Try to find it from the TouchEvent page. You won’t.</p>
<p>Alternatively, try finding the same information from the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/navigation/index.html" class="external">Safari Reference Library home page</a>. Search works — if you know what to search for. The official navigation is absolutely useless.</p>
<p>Apple’s pseudo-frames or something also drive me crazy. The keyboard focus does not snap to the actual documentation page, which means I initially can’t scroll. (Firefox)</p>
<p>Apple, please fix.</p>

		<p class="preamble">Every now and then I need to ask a client or another developer to save a copy of a web page and email it to me. Mostly it is because they are viewing a page that is behind a firewall and I need to see the markup. Something that happens a lot is that they send me HTML that is more or less mangled.</p>
<p>This HTML mangling happens when you choose “Web Page, complete” or a similarly named option in your web browser. With this option selected, browsers don’t save just the HTML source of the page – they also save any associated images, stylesheets, javascript files and other resources and change all references to those files to make them point to the locally saved copy.</p>

		<p><a title="Link to CSSquirrel #52: Nice Hat" href="http://www.cssquirrel.com/comic/?comic=52">Today’s comic</a> features a hat. It’s not your ordinary chapeau, but rather the sort of stately headpiece that could keep an entirely family warm at night or help you sneak into Soviet-era Russia. Even if I didn’t have a web design-related topic to discuss (and I assure you, I do), the gravity of this hat would be enough to ensure that your visit to my site today was not a waste.</p>
<p>Joining the hat in today’s strip is <a title="Link to Dave Shea" href="http://mezzoblue.com/" target="_blank">Dave Shea</a> and <a title="Link to Jeff Croft" href="http://jeffcroft.com/" target="_blank">Jeff Croft</a>. These fine gentlemen appear with the squirrel to help present to you a visual gag that points to one simple, inescapable truth: CSS gradients will break your brain.</p>
<p>I’m trying to get up to speed on CSS3, a goal which falls in the same category of absurdity as tasting every variety of curry in India; there’s simply too many modules piling up in that spec. At this point I suspect that CSS3 will not reach a finished state prior to the web being replaced by the psionic slave networks that our future robot overlords will use to broadcast their diabolical commands to the human race.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I am digging out the fruits of the cutting edge of our darling cascading style sheets, especially the previously Webkit-only features that have been newly adopted by the recently released Firefox 3.6. One area I focused on this past Thursday was CSS Gradients. After all, how hard an a gradient be?</p>
<p>How hard indeed.</p>
<p>I present Exhibit A: my <a title="Link to a tweet by Kyle Weems" href="http://twitter.com/cssquirrel/statuses/8344406305" target="_blank">tweet</a> less than five minutes after opening <a title="Link to Mozilla's tutorial on CSS gradients" href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/11/css-gradients-firefox-36/" target="_blank">Mozilla’s tutorial</a> on the topic. It starts out easy enough, then they start talking about things like color-stops, linear vs. radial gradients, starting points and angles, etc. It gets worse when you learn that Webkit and Mozilla each approach gradients differently, continuing the spaghetti western tradition of dueling methodologies.</p>
<p>In short order, my tweet was answered by <a title="Link to a tweet by Dave Shea" href="http://twitter.com/mezzoblue/statuses/8344472425" target="_blank">Dave</a>, then <a title="Link to a tweet by Jeff Croft" href="http://twitter.com/jcroft/statuses/8344724198" target="_blank">Jeff</a>, each adding to my diagnosis: CSS gradients are a pain.</p>
<p>I’m currently working on a tutorial on the topic, something that hopefully explains it in a more digestible format than what I’ve seen thus far. Until then, the only way I can provide you comfort is to inform you that the hat in today’s strip is based in reality. Here is a picture of <a title="Link to a picture of Dave Shea on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/theadnostic/4113533047/" target="_blank">Dave in the hat</a>.</p>
<p>If you did not spit your tea/milk/soda/liquor/pepto onto your computer screen just now, you have no sense of humor. I almost died of laughter when I saw that picture. Its existence was like a special jewel reminding me that dreams come true.</p>
<p>For the sake of equal treatment, I’ll share with you what I found a few minutes later while getting a reference picture of Jeff to touch up his character’s appearance. I stumbled upon <a title="Link to a picture of Jeff Croft on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jcroft/2596756/" target="_blank">this</a>. Yeah… it speaks for itself. I’m not sure when I can fit that into a comic, but I’m certainly going to try.</p>
<p>If neither photo cracked your head, than I recommend checking out CSS gradients. If you’re feeling woozy, no worries. I’ll get back to you in a few days with some digestible tidbits on how to tackle them.</p>

		<p>Usually when I mention Mark Pilgrim, it is with a dismayed tone that is meant to paint him as a dastardly villain who is elbow-deep in foul rituals meant to permanently stain the reputation of the HTML5 effort; an implication is made that he is resurrecting some great beast that will swallow the earth whole and enslave our souls.</p>
<p>What I’m saying is that, on average, I’m not a fan of his work.</p>
<p>However, his recent blog post “<a title="Link to Mark Pilgrim's Tinkerer's Sunset" href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2010/01/29/tinkerers-sunset" target="_blank">Tinkerer’s Sunset</a>” clearly states the case of why the direction the iPad is moving the market is a sad affair. A man who learned his craft on an Apple IIe, he’s dismayed at the thought of the next generation of tinkerers, who will have to pay a fee or commit crimes in order to look under the hood of <em>their own computers</em>.</p>
<p>Many claim the iPad represents what the future of computing will look like: tailored, “safe” devices with little room for modification or customization (unless you plan on spending some time in court). Maybe that’s how it’ll be, and there’s little to be said or done. But Mark helps illustrate why that future will be a sad one. <a title="Link to Mark Pilgrim's Tinkerer's Sunset" href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2010/01/29/tinkerers-sunset" target="_blank">Go read his post</a>.</p>

		<p>When <a href="http://nanocr.eu/">DVD Jon</a> was arrested after breaking the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Scramble_System">CSS encryption algorithm</a>, he was charged with “unauthorized computer trespassing.” That led his lawyers to ask the obvious question, “On whose computer did he trespass?” The prosecutor’s answer: “<a href="http://craphound.com/msftdrm.txt">his own</a>.”</p>
<p>If that doesn’t make your heart skip a beat, you can stop reading now.</p>
<p>When I was growing up, “trespassing” was something you could only do to <em>other</em> people’s computers. But let’s set that aside and come back to it.</p>
<p>My father was a college professor for much of his adult life. One year, he took a sabbatical to write a book. He had saved up enough money to buy a computer and a newfangled thing called a word processing program. And he wrote, and he edited, and he wrote some more. It was so obviously better than working on a typewriter that he never questioned that it was money well spent.</p>
<p>As it happens, this computer came with the BASIC programming language pre-installed. You didn’t even need to boot a disk operating system. You could turn on the computer and press <kbd>Ctrl-Reset</kbd> and you’d get a prompt. And at this prompt, you could type in <em>an entire program</em>, and then type <kbd>RUN</kbd>, and it would motherfucking run.</p>
<p>I was 10. That was 27 years ago, but I still remember what it felt like when I realized that you — that <em>I</em> — could get this computer to do <em>anything</em> by typing the right words in the right order and telling it to <kbd>RUN</kbd> and it would motherfucking run.</p>
<p>That computer was an Apple ][e.</p>
<p>By age 12, I was writing BASIC programs so complex that the computer was running out of memory to hold them. By age 13, I was writing programs in Pascal. By age 14, I was writing programs in assembly language. By age 17, I was competing in the Programming event in the National Science Olympiad (and winning). By age 22, I was employed as a computer programmer.</p>
<p>Today I am a programmer, a technical writer, and a hacker in the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html">Hackers and Painters</a> sense of the word. But you don’t become a hacker by programming; you become a hacker by <em>tinkering</em>. It’s the tinkering that provides that sense of wonder. You have to jump out of the system, tear down the safety gates, peel away the layers of abstraction that the computer provides for the vast majority of people who don’t want to know how it all works. It’s about <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/08/22/c600g">using the Copy ][+ sector editor</a> to learn how the disk operating system boots, then modifying it so the computer makes a sound every time it reads a sector from the disk. Or displaying a graphical splash screen on startup before it lists the disk catalog and takes you to that BASIC prompt. Or copying a myriad of wondrous commands from the <a href="http://www.lazilong.com/apple_II/bbros/">Beagle Bros. Peeks &amp; Pokes Chart</a> and trying to figure out what the fuck I had just done. Just for the hell of it. Because it was fun. Because it scared my parents. Because I absolutely had to know how it all worked.</p>
<p>Later, there was an Apple IIgs. And later still, a Mac IIci. MacsBug. ResEdit. Norton Disk Editor. Stop me if any of this sounds familiar.</p>
<p>Apple made the machines that made me who I am. I became who I am by tinkering.</p>
<p>This post’s title is stolen from <a href="http://al3x.net/2010/01/28/ipad.html">Alex Payne’s “On the iPad,”</a> which I shall now quote at great length.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://al3x.net/2010/01/28/ipad.html">
<p>The iPad is an attractive, thoughtfully designed, deeply cynical thing. It is a digital consumption machine. As <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/01/27/iPad">Tim Bray</a> and <a href="http://createdigitalmusic.com/2010/01/27/how-a-great-product-can-be-bad-news-apple-ipad-and-the-closed-mac/">Peter Kirn</a> have pointed out, it’s a device that does little to enable creativity...</p>
<p>The tragedy of the iPad is that it truly seems to offer a better model of computing for many people — perhaps the majority of people. Gone are the confusing concepts and metaphors of the last thirty years of computing. Gone is the ability to endlessly tweak and twiddle towards no particular gain. The iPad is simple, straightforward, maintenance-free...</p>
<p>The thing that bothers me most about the iPad is this: if I had an iPad rather than a real computer as a kid, I’d never be a programmer today. I’d never have had the ability to run whatever stupid, potentially harmful, hugely educational programs I could download or write. I wouldn’t have been able to fire up ResEdit and edit out the Mac startup sound so I could tinker on the computer at all hours without waking my parents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I am aware that you will be able to develop your own programs for the iPad, the same way you can develop for the iPhone today. Anyone can develop! All you need is a Mac, XCode, an iPhone “simulator,” and <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/program/">$99 for an auto-expiring developer certificate</a>. The “developer certificate” is really a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">cryptographic key</a> that (temporarily) allows you (slightly) elevated access to... your own computer. And that’s fine — or at least workable — for the developers of today, because they already know that they’re developers. But the developers of tomorrow don’t know it yet. And without the <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/about">freedom to tinker</a>, some of them never will.</p>
<p>(As a side note, <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2009/11/21/living-in-a-browser">I was wrong</a> and <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2009/11/21/living-in-a-browser#comment-13567">Fredrik was right</a>, and Chrome OS devices <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/firmware-boot-and-recovery#Support_developers_l33t_users_">will have a switch for developers to run their own local code</a>. I don’t know the specifics of what it will look like, whether it will be a hardware button or switch or whatever. But it will be there, an officially supported mode for the developers of today and, more importantly, the developers of tomorrow.)</p>
<p>And I know, I know, I know you can “jailbreak” your iPhone, (re)gain root access, and run anything that can motherfucking run. And I have no doubt that someone will figure out how to “jailbreak” the iPad, too. But I don’t want to live in a world where <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/10/04/if-wishes-were-iphones">you have to break into your own computer</a> before you can start tinkering. And I certainly don’t want to live in a world where tinkering with your own computer is illegal. (DVD Jon was acquitted, by the way. <a href="http://w2.eff.org/effector/HTML/effect16.07.html#VI">The prosecutor appealed</a>, and he was acquitted again. But who needs the law when you have public key cryptography on your side?)</p>
<p>Once upon a time, Apple made the machines that made me who I am. I became who I am by tinkering. Now it seems they’re doing everything in their power to stop <em>my</em> kids from <a href="http://stevenf.com/beagle/legacy.html">finding that sense of wonder</a>. Apple has declared war on the tinkerers of the world. With every software update, the previous generation of “jailbreaks” stop working, and people have to find new ways to break into their own computers. There won’t ever be a MacsBug for the iPad. There won’t be a ResEdit, or a Copy ][+ sector editor, or an iPad Peeks &amp; Pokes Chart. And that’s a real loss. Maybe not to you, but to somebody who doesn’t even know it yet.</p>

		<p>Ok, the iPad.</p>
<p>Whoop-dee-freaking-doo.</p>
<p>I’m annoyed by all the defense of the device’s failures by my peers who are justifying the shortcomings as features that only mega-geeks want; they say that the mythical ‘average user’, like some strange breed of lobotomized unicorn, is not interested in these issues. (*cough* Jeff Croft’s <a title="Link to iPad Thoughts by Jeff Croft" href="http://jeffcroft.com/blog/2010/jan/28/ipad-thoughts/" target="_blank">iPad Thoughts</a> and Jason Beaird’s <a title="iPad: It's Not For Us by Jason Beaird" href="http://jasongraphix.com/journal/ipad-its-not-for-us/" target="_blank">iPad: It’s not for us</a> are two stellar examples of this ‘average user’ argument *cough*)</p>
<p>Really? Are you patting yourself on the back that much about how awesome you are that you think it’s still 1999 and we’re logging onto the Internet via a series of loud angry screeches? (Oh dialup modems, how I don’t miss you.) Virtually everyone (in America, at least) uses browsers on a very regular basis. Over 350 million people use Facebook. There’s been these little instant messaging programs with names like MSN or gTalk  for a long, long time now. My friend’s grandparents use Skype to talk to their friends in other countries.</p>
<p>What these people lack isn’t a taste for the features we geeks have been talking about. What they lack is the terminology for it. My mom isn’t going to say she wants “multitasking.” She is, however, going to want to have her browser open to look at websites while having access to her IM program to chat with family and friends.</p>
<p>That basic pair of tasks: browsing + chat, does not exist on the iPad. That is a single example that fits the everyday life of millions of people. To tell me that some sort of mythical upper class are the only ones who want to do that is to live a magical life in Narnia, where your friends are mostly talking animals; the majority of which lack opposable thumbs.</p>
<p>One last thing: the App Store. You want to run a program on the iPad? Better hope that Apple wants you to have it. Have fun surfing the Internet without Flash. For better or worse, a good part of the web still runs on it. Apple seems to be pushing farther towards a closed ecosystem, which is the complete opposite of what most of us standardistas believe in. You can’t pretend the device is the replacement to a netbook when it doesn’t have the same breadth and variety of software. Some people celebrate it, claiming the closed ecosystem of the App Store makes it somehow better, filled only with quality software.</p>
<p>Like <a title="Link to iFart" href="http://ifartmobile.com/" target="_blank">iFart</a>, which for a time was the #1 app in the store.</p>
<p>The iPad does have a lot going for it (however, the name is killing me.) But let’s not pretend that we’re some rare breed of horse, and that these shortcomings only impact 1% of users. Because that’s clearly a fantasy, and the average person lives in the real world, just like us.</p>

		<p><a title="Link to CSSquirrel #51: When I Die, Burn Me Viking Style" href="http://www.cssquirrel.com/comic/?comic=51">Today’s comic</a> explores a subject that is one of the most difficult, for me at least, to approach humorously. Featuring <a title="Link to Eric Meyer" href="http://meyerweb.com/" target="_blank">Eric Meyer</a>, <a title="Link to Jeffrey Zeldman" href="http://zeldman.com/" target="_blank">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> and <a title="Link to Dylan Wilbanks" href="http://dylanwilbanks.com/" target="_blank">Dylan Wilbanks</a> (I love his site’s content), I think I manage it with the grace and agility only a fifty-foot lizard could manage.</p>
<p>Over the past couple weeks, some people have died. Well, thousands die every week, even without disasters like the one that has recently struck Haiti. With no disrespect meant to the many who have died, it was the death of two specific individuals that caused an attention-worthy explosion of conversation in my Twitter feed, and I didn’t know either one of them: <a title="Link to Brad L. Graham" href="http://twitter.com/thebrad/" target="_blank">Brad L. Graham</a> and <a title="Link to Jack Pickard" href="http://twitter.com/thepickards/" target="_blank">Jack Pickard</a>. I linked their Twitter feeds, as I don’t know how enduring the website of either individual will be after their death (a topic addressed in more detail below).</p>
<p>Their passing started a discussion on death, both theirs and that of others.</p>
<p>Eric Meyer had a <a title="Link to a tweet by Eric Meyer" href="http://twitter.com/meyerweb/statuses/7992406198" target="_blank">couple</a> of <a title="Link to a tweet by Eric Meyer" href="http://twitter.com/meyerweb/statuses/7991886177" target="_blank">tweets</a> that highlighted the poignancy of loss, even over a digital medium. Jeffrey Zeldman, in a post entitled <a title="Link to Posthumous Hosting and Digital Culture by Jeffrey Zeldman" href="http://www.zeldman.com/2010/01/21/posthumous-hosting-and-digital-culture/" target="_blank">Posthumous Hosting and Digital Culture</a>, addresses the Big Question (well, its little cousin): “Where do our sites go when we die?” I’d like to think that the entire readership of my site are aware of how fragile the survival of sites on the Internet is, as highlighted in <a title="CSSquirrel #42: The Death of Geocities and the Robot Apocalypse" href="http://www.cssquirrel.com/comic/?comic=42">this strip that discussed the end of Geocities</a>.</p>
<p>If we hope to have any lasting legacy for friends, family or a curious future, we can’t hope for a copy of a book resting on a shelf for a few hundred years. Instead, we need to think, while alive, about how we’re going to preserve our digital identities (which have become a huge part of who we are) long enough so that those who come after can decide for themselves whether it was worth it.</p>
<p>Dylan Wilbanks recently had a presentation at <a title="Link to Ignite Seattle" href="http://www.igniteseattle.com/" target="_blank">Ignite Seattle</a> about this very topic. <a title="Link to Everyone Coredumps" href="http://www.slideshare.net/wnalyd/everyone-coredumps" target="_blank">Everyone Coredumps</a>, he reminds us, and he addresses both the grieving process and how to preserve your online data for future generations. He also discusses viking funerals. Check out his <a title="Link to Everyone Coredumps" href="http://www.slideshare.net/wnalyd/everyone-coredumps" target="_blank">slides</a> for thoughts on the topic, especially the tips on keeping your websites alive beyond the grave.</p>
<p>I recently was reminded by my registrar that I need to get this site’s domain registration renewed. It’s disturbing to think that if a bus hit me today, the laughs I’ve created would simply disappear at the end of the month, well before any tears from my passing would (hopefully) have ended.</p>
<p>I think I’m going to go get that renewal handled right now.</p>

		<p>Well, a new year has started, and it’s tradition to give an overview of where you’re standing. So here’s mine.</p>
<p>As longtime readers may remember, I was totally burned out at the end of both 2007 and 2008. I’m happy to report that that trend has been broken; although I was glad to have a little holiday at the end of 2009, I returned to work without noticeable problems. So that’s good.</p>
<p>However, I have decided that certain aspects of my professional life are in need of a change; notably my public speaking and my compatibility tables.</p>
<h3>Conferences</h3>
<p>Basically I’m going off the conference track for a while in order to spend more time with my mobile phones.</p>
<p>I will honour agreements made beforehand, which means I’ll speak at the following occasions:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.digitalsparksnw.com/transmissions/" class="external">Transmissions 3</a>, Manchester, 28th of January, together with <a href="http://my.opera.com/chrismills/blog/" class="external">Chris Mills</a>. The focus of this meeting will be the mobile Web.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.techniqueretreat.com/" class="external">Technique Retreat</a>, 29th to 31st of January in Morecambe, near Manchester. Here I’ll be a trainer and workshop leader. If you want to do a bit of JavaScript or mobile web development with me around to help you, sign up. There’s still a few tickets left.</li>
<li>Dutch: Sessie op de Howest te Kortrijk over het mobiele web, in de week van 29 maart.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.dibiconference.com/" class="external">DIBI</a> conference in Newcastle upon Tyne, 28th of April. I’ll speak about the mobile Web.</li>
<li>It’s possible one item will be added to this list.</li>
</ol>
<p>After that, though, I will be very reticent in accepting new speaking gigs. The problem is not the speaking itself or hanging around at conferences with interesting people and beers, but the travel.</p>
<p>I have to travel to Düsseldorf at least once per month, and that’s OK because it’s always interesting and I’m also paid for this effort. Besides, I can do it by train.</p>
<p>Conference travel usually involves flying, though, and the latest round of air-travel-related hysterics starts to grate on my nerves. Once more we see an addition of pointless security measures that won’t make us much safer but will annoy the hell out of everybody in addition to cheerfully violating every single aspect of our privacy.</p>
<p>I object to the whole scare stuff; this is exactly what the bad guys want, and right now authorities around the world are being, well, authoritative and authoritarian in order to reinforce the terrorists’ message. Stupid idiots.</p>
<p>I especially object to the requirement to put bananas in my ears for the entire duration of the flight in order to scare away the terrorists.</p>
<p>So I’ve decided not to come to SxSW this year. It will be hard on me once the happy tweets start to come in, but flying to the US is becoming less and less attractive, as is the formal content of SxSW. (The parties will be great, I trust.) I have no further US travel planned this year, and as far as I’m concerned I will not plan any, either.</p>
<p>In addition, conference speaking involves a significant investment of time, and I find myself less and less willing to do that, mostly because it leaves me too little time to do the fundamental mobile research I’m paid to do and want to do. Besides, I have an awful lot of writing to do about the mobile space, and that, too, is something that’s suffering from my being on the road so often.</p>
<p>Finally, I’ve given up JavaScript speaking entirely, and that has reduced my value as a speaker. Traditional web conferences aren’t really interested in the mobile Web as yet. That’ll change, but not this year.</p>
<p>Theoretically this loss of speaking gigs could be offset by invitations for mobile conferences, but it turns out that the mobile world has a strong cultural bias against paying flight and hotel for speakers.</p>
<p>So I’ll have significantly less conferences this year than the past few years. Actually I’m looking forward to that.</p>
<h3>Compatibility tables</h3>
<p>The second change is my view of my <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/compatibility.html">compatibility tables</a>.</p>
<p>A year ago I already noticed that I became less and less interested in measuring the desktop browsers’ compatibility. Everybody just supports all the standards, even IE, and in my last round of desktop testing I did not encounter even one juicy new bug. Great for web development, boring for me.</p>
<p>I’ve been into the mobile Web for eleven months now, and there’s little chance I’ll ever return to the “fixed web” and its fast-decreasing problems. That will have consequences for the tables.</p>
<p>When I started my mobile research last March I automatically opened my desktop test pages on mobile phones and as usual started to create tables with test results. There were far less problems than I expected; even purportedly bad browsers such as BlackBerry, NetFront and Obigo supported quite a bit of CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>However, now that I’ve worked on the mobile browsers for a while it’s becoming increasingly apparent that I’ve been testing for the wrong stuff.</p>
<p>What I’m doing in the tables is atomic feature testing. Does browser X support the <code>+</code> selector, or <code>querySelectorAll</code>, or whatever? It turns out that this is the wrong question for mobile.</p>
<p>Mobile browsers have trouble not so much with atomic support, but with supporting the unified whole of web technologies. The BlackBerry browser scores surprisingly well on an atomic level, but once you actually send it a medium-complex JavaScript it gives up and hangs. That’s something you’ll never figure out when you only run tests like mine.</p>
<p>So I’ve started to change my focus. For the past two months I’ve been doing fundamental research into several areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Window and viewport width, with emphasis on media queries. If you use <code>@media all and (max-width: 400px)</code>, exactly which element is measured to see if it’s smaller than 400px? The answer turns out to be so complicated that I have to redo all my tests to make sure I’m right. It seems I found at least three different models.</li>
<li>If you touch the screen of a touchscreen, exactly what happens? Which events fire? How does the browser distinguish between a click and a scroll action? (The short answer is: badly.) I’m not yet ready with this research; creating the test page took more time than I thought.</li>
<li>HTML5 (according to my own definition). This is going slowly. How do you test the online and offline events on mobile phones? Ideally, I’d have to break the data connection without changing anything on the phone itself, because that’s what will happen in practice. But how?</li>
</ol>
<p>These examples show that my mobile research will have to move beyond the relatively simple tests I’ve been doing on the desktop for so long.</p>
<p>In turn, that means that I have to change my compatibility tables somehow. I’m not yet sure how I’m going to change them and whether I will give up desktop research entirely.</p>
<p>I will continue to host the old ones even if I decide not to update them any more, so you can still come here to find answers to the more basic compatibility questions. But expect some changes to the tables.</p>

<p>Over the past month I have been reading <strong>jQuery Enlightenment</strong> by Cody Lindley. Let me say now, that if you use jQuery or are thinking about using jQuery then you should most certainly <strong><a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/jquery-enlightenment/7640934">buy this book</a></strong>. It’s a quick read (122 pages) that includes colorized code samples, easy to follow examples and solid explanations.</p>
<p>Author Cody Lindley is a member of the jQuery team and explains why he wrote the book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>jQuery Enlightenment was written to express, in short-order, the concepts essential to intermediate and advanced jQuery development. Its purpose is to instill in you, the reader, practices that jQuery developers take as common knowledge. Each chapter contains concepts essential to becoming a seasoned jQuery developer.</p>
<p>This book is intended for three types of readers. The first is someone who has read introductory books on jQuery and is looking for the next logical step. The second type of reader is a JavaScript developer, already versed in another library, now trying to quickly learn jQuery. The third reader is myself, the author. I crafted this book to be used as my own personal reference point for jQuery concepts. This is exactly the type of book I wish every JavaScript library had available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would argue that this book is perfectly suitable for beginners too. It’s simply a must have jQuery book. It’s the only one you need; it will take you from beginner to competent user.</p>
<p>I do ASP.NET / C# web development where I build web-based software for school districts. My preferred architecture is one in which I use NO server-controls. That means no GridViews, no Repeaters, no ListViews. If fact, nothing that uses runat server will be found on the page. The page will only consist of XHTML. So there is no need for a viewstate either. We end up using jQuery a lot in this architecture. We use jQuery / Ajax to call Web services that then query the database using LINQ to SQL and pass our data back to the client where we can then populate our XHTML controls. It works great and is extremely fast and efficient. The code couldn’t be cleaner. In addition, this methodology would allow you to easily change to a PHP or Java backend and you wouldn’t have to change a single thing on the frontend. I will give a full example on this methodology another time, but the point is – you need to learn jQuery.</p>
<p>For more information on the jQuery Enlightenment book, including a breakdown of each chapter go <strong><a href="http://jqueryenlightenment.com/">here</a></strong>. I would recommend buying the full color book from lulu.com as it’s well designed and very handy to have on your desk.</p>

		<p>Last Friday I found evidence for increasing confusion about what the HTML5 spec actually is. I don’t have any doubts on that score: HTML5 is anything you want it to be as long as it’s new and cool.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20100108#l-593" class="external">discussion</a> on the WHAT-WG IRC channel <a href="http://adactio.com" class="external">Jeremy</a> got fed up with the fact that he can’t just point people at the spec during his HTML5 evangelism:</p>
<blockquote>I&#039;m doing my damndest to evangelise HTML5 to front end developers and designers but you guys don&#039;t make it easy.<br>
[...]<br>
As if this stuff wasn&#039;t confusing enough for authors already. Now they have to put up with stupid spec obfuscation for the sake of some minor semantic victory for someone somewhere.<br>
[...]<br>
The WHATWG couldn&#039;t make the spec more author-unfriendly if they tried.</blockquote>
<p>Inevitably, it was pointed out that specs aren’t meant for developers but for browser vendors. That’s true but unhelpful, just as it has been for the past ten years. The ritual dance begins anew.</p>
<p>Personally, I’m not going to take part in the dance this time. I already know what the outcome is going to be, and I’m going to skip the rituals.</p>
<p>Because “HTML5” is so vaguely defined we web developers can decide for ourselves what is part of HTML5 and what isn’t, and that’s something I’m looking forward to. (If spec defenders don’t like that they should have been clearer.)</p>
<p>My favourite examples are <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation-API/" class="external">geolocation</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/" class="external">Web Storage</a>, which will feature prominently in my upcoming HTML5 mobile compatibility tables despite the fact that they’re not in the spec. They’re new, exciting, and absolutely vital on mobile. They’re in <em>my</em> HTML5 spec.</p>
<p>HTML5 is the continuation of Web 2.0 by other means, just as Web 2.0 was the continuation of DHTML. Apparently we need a vague, all-encompassing term for cool new stuff that we want browsers to support and clients to buy so we can play with it.</p>
<p>That’s what HTML5 should be. Because there are new and exciting things going on, people will start to make wish lists. Exactly which items on those lists are described in a document called “HTML5” will slowly cease to matter, as long as they have some browser support.</p>
<p>As soon as a certain feature appears on enough HTML5 lists it will become canonical. Conversely, the stuff that nobody’s really interested in will no longer be HTML5, even if it’s in a spec with that name.</p>
<p>I consider this a Good Thing. Wisdom of the crowds and all that. (Again, if spec defenders don’t like it, they should have been more accomodating to authors.)</p>
<p>So what’s in <em>your</em> HTML5 spec? Top three, anyone?</p>

<p>This started as a joke, but I thought I would share the additional thoughts I have anyway in an attempt to make my blog more <span>&quot;boeiend&quot;</span> (ask <a href="http://krijnhoetmer.nl/">Krijn</a>). A few of these tips are only valid under HTML5, but will work everywhere else too (e.g. in HTML4 or XHTML1). Because well, as you know, HTML5 actually reflects reality. Blah blah. (In the event you have no idea what I am talking about, this is a somewhat response to <a href="http://perfectionkills.com/optimizing-html/">Optimizing HTML</a>.)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;…&quot; <strong>type=&quot;text/css&quot;</strong>&gt;</code> — Nobody is using that <code>type</code> attribute. It is just sitting there making your <code>link</code> element less readable and makes it consume slightly more memory due to the additional attribute. You can do this right now as this is valid in all versions of HTML. Apart from the validator versions is a dead concept as far as HTML is concerned, but people seem to care about them. (And some even care enough about them to battle for introducing them in HTML5. Weird world.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>&lt;style <strong>type=&quot;text/css&quot;</strong>&gt;</code> — Same trick, different element. There is only one styling language for the Web in existence and that is CSS. Whenever we introduce a new one (if ever) we can start to use the <code>type</code> attribute. It is a waste of bandwidth and source code reading time to include it now. Then again, including the <code>style</code> element itself is hardly ever needed. Think again when you do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>&lt;script <strong>type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;</strong>&gt;</code> — The only reason you ever want to include this attribute is if you want to specify a different JavaScript version. Indeed, you do not use the <code>language</code> attribute for this. However, you probably do not want to do that either since it is very much vendor-specific. You know, dragons and all. Having said that, to enable e.g. JavaScript 1.8 in Gecko you would use <code>type=&quot;text/javascript;version=1.8&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>type</code> attribute can very often also be nuked from other elements, such as <code>a</code> and <code>object</code> (if your server configuration is correct). The cases mentioned above are just the most common (well, there is <code>input</code> of course, but it was already mentioned in the original post).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code><strong>&lt;link rel=&quot;shortcut icon&quot;&gt;</strong></code> — While this should actually be just <code>type=&quot;icon&quot;</code> you can remove this element altogether by simply having a <code>/favicon.ico</code> resource. This will also reduce the amount of 404 traffic you get on your site; potentially substantially. Do not worry about the extension, you can put any file format there your browser supports and configure the <code>Content-Type</code> header appropriately using your server. If you have no idea how to do that let me tell you that it does not really matter anyway since browsers will sniff the MIME type of the resource regardless. Oooh, evil. Just avoid the HTTP gods and you should be safe. (Well-known locations are evil too, but we lost this battle.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trashing Trailing Slashes</strong> — Including the space usually in front of them, to be complete! Lots of people bought into the XHTML fad and end their tags with <code> /&gt;</code> rather than <code>&gt;</code>. Besides that this is useless it takes up two more characters per element of which the only effect is that it increases the time (not noticeable though) that software will take to download and parse the document. The claim that everything is now consistently closed makes no sense since e.g. <code>script</code> does not accept this notation. You need to know exactly which elements do not have an end tag and if you already do why would you add cruft to their start tag? I know, I know, to please the XML gods. Pleasing the XML gods makes no sense in a HTML world. There.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The original post mentions anti-patterns as well. Let me give some contradictory advice. Please do replace <code>em</code> with <code>i</code> and <code>strong</code> with <code>b</code>. The resulting markup is likely more accurate. Especially with WYSIWYG software it is extremely unlikely they will be used correctly, but also because the notion spread that they are interchangeable with the sole difference being that <code>strong</code> and <code>em</code> are semantic a lot of misuse happened. When in doubt, use <code>i</code> and <code>b</code>. And in most other cases probably too. (Does anyone know if there is a plug-in for WordPress that fixes this?)</p>
<p>As a final &quot;tip&quot;, if you do not care much for cross-browser compatibility you can get rid of <code>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;</code> entirely. Investigate <a href="http://id.annevankesteren.nl/">id.annevankesteren.nl</a> for details.</p>

<p>I had fun compiling this <a href="http://annevankesteren.nl/2008/12/year-in-cities" title="My year in cities, 2008">last year</a> so I thought I would do it again now I am pretty sure I will not leave the country before it is 2010. This time it is in chronological order with duplicates removed, as far as I can remember anyway. I renamed it to places (rather than cities) mostly because of <a href="http://annevankesteren.nl/2009/07/greenland-iceland">Greenland and Iceland</a>, that deserve a mention, but in neither we stayed in a city long enough. Also added some annotations here and there.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oslo, Norway; I celebrated new year abroad</li>
<li>Utrecht, the Netherlands; contrary to what some people believe, I actually do still live here</li>
<li>Zeist, the Netherlands</li>
<li>Tokyo, Japan; CSS WG, staying at <a href="http://sideshowbarker.net/">Michael(tm)</a>&#039;s place was a lot of fun. Really want to go back to Tokyo. Hopefully in 2010.</li>
<li>Nikkō, Japan; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/annevk/sets/72157615943569583/">hiking around a lake in the snow</a>, very much awesome</li>
<li>Lisbon, Portugal</li>

<li>Yosemite National Park, CA, United States; saw some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/annevk/4077520256/">big trees</a> and hiked for twenty-five miles the day after we arrived in SFO. A little crazy, but a lot of fun too!</li>
<li>San Francisco, CA, United States; Halloween!</li>
<li>Santa Clara, CA, United States; W3C meeting time, lots of fun meeting friends again, though quite exhausting too.</li>
<li>Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; this was an awesome visit, however short. Thanks a lot Patrick!</li>

<p>We are getting a little better at this iteration stuff. Opera 10 was released in September and now <a href="http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/2009/12/22/from-all-of-us-to-all-of-you" title="From all of us to all of you">we are releasing</a> the first public build of Opera 10.5. Yay Desktop Team! <a href="http://foolip.org/">Philip</a> was on vacation so the HTML5 media elements (i.e. <code>video</code> and <code>audio</code>) are not yet in, but CSS transformations and transitions are. Hopefully we get this to final soon as it is a major improvement not just in standards support, but also in usability and speed. (And also so we get to try it on Ubuntu!)</p>

<p>I planned to post this way earlier but travel, jetlag, and a general feel that the entry was not quite finished got in the way. It seems to slow process on posting other things though so here it is.</p>
<p>I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of fights. The W3C did their part by providing us with popcorn and nachos, but none of the discussions about accessibility, distributed extensibility, extensions to host objects that cannot be implemented by ECMAScript directly, a language specification for HTML, et cetera went beyond polite discourse. Boring!</p>
<p>It is pretty clear we are reaching the end of the process. The specification no longer has major holes and the remaining issues are around differences of perspective on how certain issues need to be tackled. Of course, if at one point we decide to go the other way on one of these the outcome may be disruptive, but it does not seem all that likely.</p>
<p>The HTML WG did run again in unconference-style and the only thing I think we should here is gauge the level of interest in certain topics before giving them a one or half an hour slot. If there is just one person talking all the time it is not that interesting and we might as well have read an email outlining his position at some other point.</p>

<p>I just spent an hour in Starbucks. (My kid is down the street at a Chinese class.) In the past hour, I’ve checked my email, read news, caught up on the HTML5 mailing lists and IRC chatter, paid two bills, balanced my checkbook, and written this post. Without leaving my browser.</p>
<p>So yeah, <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html">Google Chrome OS</a> is gonna be a hit.</p>
<p><del>Bummer about the whole “only runs apps <a title="If you don't own the master (key), the master owns you" href="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22if+you+don't+own+the+master%22+lyrics">signed by a private key</a> that Google won’t be sharing with anyone” thing. I’m not thrilled about the prospect of working for a DRM company. Google was in the DRM business once before; it ended with <a href="http://googlewatch.eweek.com/content/google_video/google_admits_to_fixes_video_refund_gaffe.html">giving everyone their money back, twice</a>. And does anyone honestly believe the first Chrome OS machine won’t be jailbroken within a week?</del> Update: I’m getting conflicting reports about whether retail (non-developer) Chrome OS hardware will include a way to run unverified software. I’m locking this discussion thread until I can confirm this important detail.</p>
<p>On the other hand, computer maintenance sucks gargantuan donkey balls, and normal people don’t care about root. If you accost a random person on the street and ask them if they need root on their operating system to install another browser, and they’ll have three questions for you: 1. What’s root? 2. What’s an operating system? 3. <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/06/browser-is-search-engine.html">What’s a browser</a>?</p>
<p>Still… if I had root on a Linux netbook, the first thing I’d do is install Chromium and then spend 99% of my time in the browser. So I have to think that Chrome OS is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>This is an open thread, but I won’t answer any questions on behalf of Google.</p>

<p>The Plenary Day was not that interesting this year. There was a Developer Day the next day, which was probably better, but I could not make it due to a conflict with the HTML WG meeting (labeled HTML5 WG by the W3C Team for unstated reasons). There was the recurring HTML5 and extensibility panel. Organized each year since 2007 to gather some thoughts on how to solve a problem of which it is not very clear what the problem actually is. The whole debate made me think about the Hitchhiker&#039;s Guide. The answer is XML namespaces, but what is the question? Admittedly <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2009/10/05/distributed-unicorns-and-ponies" title="Translation From MS-Speak to English of Selected Portions of Tony Ross’ “Distributed Extensibility Submission”">the comparison with</a> unicorns and ponies is a lot cuter and likely more accurate. Unicorns in particular dominated the entire TPAC &quot;secret&quot; backchannel (<code>#unicorns</code> on <code>irc.w3.org:80</code>). Actually, not just the backchannel, they appeared in Working Group meetings, questions, presentations, and editors are adding them to specifications. Lovely.</p>
<p>The problem with the Plenary Day is that there are three-hundred or so people in the room and at least half of them is not paying attention to what is happening. Running the whole thing in unconference-style (maybe even TPAC entirely as <i>Hixie</i> suggested) would probably be much more productive for most people. So while some people are debating WS-DeathStar in one room I could be having a great time discussing the intricacies of the CSSOM with just the people that care about it without having to bore anyone else or having to explain all the background information to the one person that was not prepared. I am not really persuaded that this would go against broadening your horizon because I would not really be following a discussion on WS-DeathStar anyway.</p>
<p>TPAC is supposed to be a place where groups with some overlap in interest can work together, but in practice it is only a subset of the groups that has a particular shared interest. Given that I think it is much more productive if only the subsets meet (and maybe report back) rather than having an additional thirty people in the room who could not care less and essentially just take up space that prevents the interested people from sitting closer together and communicating more directly. The uninterested can also take up a lot of time in the round for introductions. Furthermore, the uninterested could be the interested in a different room with a different topic.</p>
<p>Another thought I have had about TPAC for a while is that it might make sense to have such a meeting for all Working Groups of which the deliverables essentially evolve around Web browsers and Web authors. I realize not everyone is a fan of that characterization but when it comes down to it there are a few groups where implementations in Web browsers that can be used by Web authors are the primary goal. I.e. WebApps, HTML, CSS, Geolocation, SVG, and a few others. Having at least one event per year to coordinate on the direction of the Web Platform would be really good I think. (Come to think of it, also a good target for terrorists.)</p>

<p>During TPAC I discussed with various people how we should tackle CSS values within the CSSOM. I had sort of given up on this myself but it seems that in order to get rid of the current <code>CSSValue</code> interface and friends we need to find a suitable alternative. And we really want to get rid of those because they are super ugly. Ian pointed this out long ago though unfortunately only in Member-only space. I have since made it available publicly as <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2009Nov/0007.html">CSSValue replacement proposal from Ian Hickson</a> so everyone can take a look at it. Hopefully it is clear that Ian no longer stands behind everything that is stated there. In fact, it was more a proof of concept. Having said that, the idea of turning the attributes that currently return a string into some kind of object does have a certain appeal. And if we can make them behave almost identically to strings I think we can make it work. It would be pretty awesome if you can increase the pixel value of the <code>left</code> property using the following rather than using all kinds of string manipulation:</p>
<pre>
<code>var ele = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;div&quot;)[0]
ele.style.left.px++</code>
</pre>
<p>Theoretically this model can actually work though once we are a little further in drafting the details of the proposal we do have to test it to make sure we are not going to break the Web because that would be bad. For instance, triple-equality checking for these special type of strings would no longer work.</p>

		<p>On February 25, 1993, <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0182.html"><cite>Marc Andreessen</cite> wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0182.html">
<p>I’d like to propose a new, optional HTML tag:</p>
<p>IMG</p>
<p>Required argument is <code>SRC=&quot;url&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>This names a bitmap or pixmap file for the browser to attempt to pull over the network and interpret as an image, to be embedded in the text at the point of the tag’s occurrence.</p>
<p>An example is:</p>
<p><code>&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;file://foobar.com/foo/bar/blargh.xbm&quot;&gt;</code></p>
<p>(There is no closing tag; this is just a standalone tag.)</p>
<p>This tag can be embedded in an anchor like anything else; when that happens, it becomes an icon that’s sensitive to activation just like a regular text anchor.</p>
<p>Browsers should be afforded flexibility as to which image formats they support. Xbm and Xpm are good ones to support, for example. If a browser cannot interpret a given format, it can do whatever it wants instead (X Mosaic will pop up a default bitmap as a placeholder).</p>
<p>This is required functionality for X Mosaic; we have this working, and we’ll at least be using it internally. I’m certainly open to suggestions as to how this should be handled within HTML; if you have a better idea than what I’m presenting now, please let me know. I know this is hazy wrt image format, but I don’t see an alternative than to just say “let the browser do what it can” and wait for the perfect solution to come along (MIME, someday, maybe).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_BitMap">Xbm</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_PixMap">Xpm</a> were popular graphics formats on Unix systems.</p>
<p>“Mosaic” was one of the earliest web browsers. (“X Mosaic” was the version that ran on Unix systems.) When he wrote this message in early 1993, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen">Marc Andreessen</a> had not yet founded the company that made him famous, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_Communications_Corporation">Mosaic Communications Corporation</a>, nor had he started work on that company’s flagship product, “Mosaic Netscape.” (You may know them better by their later names, “Netscape Corporation” and “Netscape Navigator.”)</p>
<p>“MIME, someday, maybe” is a reference to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation">content negotiation</a>, a feature of HTTP where a client (like a web browser) tells the server (like a web server) what types of resources it supports (like <code>image/jpeg</code>) so the server can return something in the client’s preferred format. <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html">The Original HTTP as defined in 1991</a> (the only version that was implemented in February 1993) did not have a way for clients to tell servers what kind of images they supported, thus the design dilemma that Marc faced.</p>
<p>A few hours later, <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0183.html"><cite>Tony Johnson</cite> replied</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0183.html">
<p>I have something very similar in Midas 2.0 (in use here at SLAC, and due for public release any week now), except that all the names are different, and it has an extra argument <code>NAME=&quot;name&quot;</code>. It has almost exactly the same functionality as your proposed <code>IMG</code> tag. e.g.</p>
<p><code>&lt;ICON name=&quot;NoEntry&quot; href=&quot;http://note/foo/bar/NoEntry.xbm&quot;&gt;</code></p>
<p>The idea of the name parameter was to allow the browser to have a set of “built in” images. If the name matches a “built in” image it would use that instead of having to go out and fetch the image. The name could also act as a hint for “line mode” browsers as to what kind of a symbol to put in place of the image.</p>
<p>I don’t much care about the parameter or tag names, but it would be sensible if we used the same things. I don’t much care for abbreviations, ie why not <code>IMAGE=</code> and <code>SOURCE=</code>. I somewhat prefer <code>ICON</code> since it imlies that the <code>IMAGE</code> should be smallish, but maybe <code>ICON</code> is an overloaded word?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MidasWWW">Midas</a> was another early web browser, a contemporary of X Mosaic. It was cross-platform; it ran on both Unix and VMS. “SLAC” refers to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Linear_Accelerator">Stanford Linear Accelerator Center</a> (now the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory). SLAC hosted the first web server in the United States (in fact <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/history/earlyweb/history.shtml">the first web server outside Europe</a>). When <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/history/earlyweb/wizards.shtml#Tony%20Johnson">Tony</a> wrote this message, SLAC was an old-timer on the WWW, having hosted <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/history/earlyweb/firstpages.shtml">five pages</a> on their web server for a whopping 441 days.</p>
<p>Tony continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While we are on the subject of new tags, I have another, somewhat similar tag, which I would like to support in Midas 2.0. In principle it is:</p>
<p><code>&lt;INCLUDE HREF=&quot;...&quot;&gt;</code></p>
<p>The intention here would be that the second document is to be included into the first document at the place where the tag occured. In principle the referenced document could be anything, but the main purpose was to allow images (in this case arbitrary sized) to be embedded into documents. Again the intention would be that when HTTP2 comes along the format of the included document would be up for separate negotiation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“HTTP2” is a reference to <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTTP2.html">Basic HTTP as defined in 1992</a>. At this point in early 1993, it was still largely unimplemented. The draft known as “HTTP2” evolved and was eventually standardized as “HTTP 1.0” (albeit <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.0/spec.html">not for another three years</a>). HTTP 1.0 did include <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTRQ_Headers.html#z3">request headers for content negotiation</a>, a.k.a. “MIME, someday, maybe.”</p>
<p>Tony continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An alternative I was considering was:</p>
<p><code>&lt;A HREF=&quot;...&quot; INCLUDE&gt;See photo&lt;/A&gt;</code></p>
<p>I don’t much like adding more functionality to the <code>&lt;A&gt;</code> tag, but the idea here is to maintain compatibility with browsers that can not honour the <code>INCLUDE</code> parameter. The intention is that browsers which do understand <code>INCLUDE</code>, replace the anchor text (in this case “See photo”) with the included document (picture), while older or dumber browsers ignore the <code>INCLUDE</code> tag completely.</p>

<p>This proposal was never implemented, although the idea of text-if-an-image-is-missing is <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/day_23_providing_text_equivalents_for_images.html">an important accessibility technique</a> which was missing from Marc’s initial <code>&lt;IMG&gt;</code> proposal. Many years later, this feature was bolted on as the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/objects.html#h-13.8"><code>&lt;img alt&gt;</code> attribute</a>, which Netscape promptly broke by <a href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/html/alt.html#tooltip">erroneously treating it as a tooltip</a>.</p>
<p>A few hours after that, <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0186.html"><cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite> responded</a>:</p>

<p>This proposal was never implemented, but Netscape did later add arbitrary embedding of media objects with the <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> element.</p>

<p>With the benefit of hindsight, it appears that Jay’s concerns were well-founded.

<p>Responding to Jay’s original message, <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0204.html"><cite>Dave Raggett</cite> said</a>:</p>

<p>Later in 1993, <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/">Dave Raggett</a> proposed <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/HTMLPlus/htmlplus_1.html">HTML+</a> as an evolution of the HTML standard. The proposal was never implemented, and it was superceded by <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_toc.html">HTML 2.0</a>. HTML 2.0 was a “retro-spec,” which means it formalized features already in common use. “<a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_1.html#SEC1.1">This specification brings together, clarifies, and formalizes a set of features</a> that roughly corresponds to the capabilities of HTML in common use prior to June 1994.”</p>
<p>Dave later wrote <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html3/CoverPage.html">HTML 3.0</a>, based on his earlier HTML+ draft. HTML 3.0 was also never implemented (outside of the W3C’s own reference implementation, <a href="http://www.w3.org/Arena/">Arena</a>), and it was superceded by <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Wilbur/">HTML 3.2</a>. HTML 3.2 was also a “retro-spec” — “<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32.html#intro">HTML 3.2 adds widely deployed features</a> such as tables, applets and text flow around images, while providing full backwards compatibility with the existing standard HTML 2.0.”</p>
<p>Dave later co-authored <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4">HTML 4.0</a> and developed <a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">HTML Tidy</a>, and went on to help with XHTML, XForms, MathML, and other modern W3C specifications.</p>
<p>Getting back to 1993, <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0209.html">Marc replied to Dave</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0209.html">
<p>Actually, maybe we should think about a general-purpose procedural graphics language within which we can embed arbitrary hyperlinks attached to icons, images, or text, or anything. Has anyone else seen Intermedia’s capabilities wrt this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermedia_(hypertext)">Intermedia</a> was a hypertext project from Brown University. It was developed from 1985 to 1991 and ran on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/UX">A/UX</a>, a Unix-like operating system for early Macintosh computers.</p>
<p>The idea of a “general-purpose procedural graphics language” did eventually catch on. Modern browsers support both <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">SVG</a> (declarative markup with embedded scripting) and <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html#the-canvas-element"><code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code></a> (procedural direct-mode graphics API), although the latter <a href="http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1089635050&amp;count=1">started as a proprietary extension</a> before being “retro-specced” by the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/">WHATWG</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0217.html"><cite>Bill Janssen</cite> replied</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0217.html">
<p>Other systems to look at which have this (fairly valuable) notion are Andrew and Slate. Andrew is built with _insets_, each of which has some interesting type, such as text, bitmap, drawing, animation, message, spreadsheet, etc. The notion of arbitrary recursive embedding is present, so that an inset of any kind can be embedded in any other kind which supports embedding. For example, an inset can be embedded at any point in the text of the text widget, or in any rectangular area in the drawing widget, or in any cell of the spreadsheet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Andrew” is a reference to the <a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~AUIS/">Andrew User Interface System</a> (although at that time it was simply known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Project">Andrew Project</a>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0215.html"><cite>Thomas Fine</cite> had a different idea</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0215.html">
<p>Here’s my opinion. The best way to do images in WWW is by using MIME. I’m sure postscript is already a supported subtype in MIME, and it deals very nicely with mixing text and graphics.</p>
<p>But it isn’t clickable, you say? Yes your right. I suspect there is already an answer to this in display postscript. Even if there isn’t the addition to standard postscript is trivial. Define an anchor command which specifies the URL and uses the current path as a closed region for the button. Since postscript deals so well with paths, this makes arbitrary button shapes trivial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_PostScript">Display Postscript</a> was an on-screen rendering technology co-developed by Adobe and NeXT.</p>
<p>This proposal was never implemented, but the idea that the best way to fix HTML is to replace it with something else altogether <a href="http://dbaron.org/log/20090707-ex-html">still pops up from time to time</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0221.html"><cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>, March 2, 1993</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0221.html">
<p>HTTP2 allows a document to contain any type which the user has said he can handle, not just registered MIME types. So one can experiment. Yes I think there is a case for postscript with hypertext. I don’t know whether display postcript has enough. I know Adobe are trying to establish their own postscript-based “PDF” which will have links, and be readable by their proprietory brand of viewers.</p>
<p>I thought that a generic overlaying language for anchors (Hytime based?) would allow the hypertext and the graphics/video standards to evolve separately, which would help both.</p>
<p>Let the <code>IMG</code> tag be <code>INCLUDE</code> and let it refer to an arbitrary document type. Or <code>EMBED</code> if <code>INCLUDE</code> sounds like a cpp include which people will expect to provide SGML source code to be parsed inline — not what was intended.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.hytime.org/">HyTime</a> was an early, SGML-based hypertext document system. It loomed large in many early discussions of HTML, and later XML.</p>
<p>Tim’s proposal for an <code>&lt;INCLUDE&gt;</code> tag was never implemented, although you can see echoes of it in <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code>, and the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> element.</p>
<p>Finally, on March 12, 1993, <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0257.html">Marc Andreessen revisited the thread</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0257.html">
<p>Back to the inlined image thread again — I’m getting close to releasing Mosaic v0.10, which will support inlined GIF and XBM images/bitmaps, as mentioned previously. …</p>
<p>We’re not prepared to support <code>INCLUDE</code>/<code>EMBED</code> at this point. … So we’re probably going to go with <code>&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;url&quot;&gt;</code> (not <code>ICON</code>, since not all inlined images can be meaningfully called icons). For the time being, inlined images won’t be explicitly content-type’d; down the road, we plan to support that (along with the general adaptation of MIME). Actually, the image reading routines we’re currently using figure out the image format on the fly, so the filename extension won’t even be significant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t really know why I wrote this. It wasn’t what I set out to write. That happens. But I am extraordinarily fascinated with all aspects of this almost-17-year-old conversation. Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP still exists. HTTP successfully evolved from 0.9 into 1.0 and later 1.1. <a href="http://www.ietf.org/dyn/wg/charter/httpbis-charter.html">And still it evolves</a>.</li>
<li>HTML still exists. That rudimentary data format — it didn’t even support inline images! — successfully evolved into 2.0, 3.2, 4.0. <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/">And still it, too, evolves</a>. HTML is an unbroken line. A twisted, knotted, snarled line, to be sure. There were plenty of “dead branches” in the evolutionary tree, places where standards-minded people got ahead of themselves (and ahead of authors and implementors). But still. Here we are, in 2009, and <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html#Examples">web pages from 1990</a> still render in modern browsers. I just loaded one up on my Android phone, and I didn’t even get prompted to “please wait while importing legacy format…”</li>
<li>HTML has always been a conversation between browser makers, authors, standards wonks, and other people who just showed up and liked to talk about angle brackets. Most of the successful versions of HTML have been “retro-specs,” catching up to the world while simultaneously trying to nudge it in the right direction. Anyone who tells you that HTML should be kept “pure” (presumably by ignoring browser makers, or ignoring authors, or both) is simply misinformed. HTML has never been pure, and all attempts to purify it have been spectacular failures, matched only by the attempts to replace it.</li>
<li>None of the browsers from 1993 still exist in any recognizable form. Netscape Navigator was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Mozilla_Application_Suite#Open_sourcing_of_Communicator">abandoned in 1998</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Mozilla_Application_Suite#Rewriting_from_scratch">rewritten from scratch</a> to create the Mozilla Suite, which was then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Mozilla_Firefox">forked to create Firefox</a>. Internet Explorer had its humble “beginnings” in “Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95,” where it was bundled with some desktop themes and a pinball game. (But of course that browser <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyglass_Mosaic">can be traced back further too</a>.)</li>
<li>Some of the operating systems from 1993 still exist, but none of them are relevant to the modern web. Most people today who “experience” the web do so on a PC running Windows 2000 or later, a Mac running Mac OS X, a PC running some flavor of Linux, or a handheld device like an iPhone. In 1993, Windows was at version 3.1 (and competing with OS/2), Macs were running System 7, and Linux was distributed via Usenet. (Want to have some fun? Find a graybeard and whisper “Trumpet Winsock” or “MacPPP.”)</li>
<li>Some of the same <em>people</em> are still around and still involved in what we now simply call “web standards.” That’s after almost 20 years. And some were involved in predecessors of HTML, going back into the 1980s and before.</li>
<li>Speaking of predecessors… With the eventual popularity of HTML and the web, it is easy to forget the contemporary formats and systems that informed its design. Andrew? Intermedia? HyTime? And HyTime was not some rinky-dink academic research project; <a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/hytime.html">it was an ISO standard</a>. It was approved for military use. It was Big Business. And you can read about it yourself… <a href="http://www.sgmlsource.com/history/hthist.htm">on this HTML page, in your web browser</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>But none of this answers the original question: why do we have an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element? Why not an <code>&lt;icon&gt;</code> element? Or an <code>&lt;include&gt;</code> element? Why not a hyperlink with an <code>include</code> attribute, or some combination of <code>rel</code> values? Why an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element? Quite simply, because Marc Andreessen shipped one, and shipping code wins.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that <em>all</em> shipping code wins; after all, Andrew and Intermedia and HyTime shipped code too. Code is necessary but not sufficient for success. And I <em>certainly</em> don’t mean to say that shipping code before a standard will produce the best solution. Marc’s <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element didn’t mandate a common graphics format; it didn’t define how text flowed around it; it didn’t support text alternatives or fallback content for older browsers. And 16, almost 17 years later, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-abarth-mime-sniff">we’re still struggling with content sniffing</a>, and it’s still <a href="http://code.google.com/p/doctype/wiki/ArticleContentSniffing">a source of crazy security vulnerabilities</a>. And you can trace that all the way back, 17 years, through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">Great Browser Wars</a>, all the way back to February 25, 1993, when Marc Andreessen offhandedly remarked, “MIME, someday, maybe,” and then shipped his code anyway.</p>
<p>The ones that win are the ones that ship.</p>

		<p>Recently, someone did the unthinkable: they published their own version of <a href="http://diveintopython.org/">Dive Into Python</a> and got it listed on Amazon.com. This apparently caused a small firestorm within Apress, the exact details of which I am not privy to, but which (I am told) became a somewhat larger firestorm after the Apress executives realized they had no legal recourse, and asked my opinion on the matter. You see, the book is published under the GNU Free Documentation License, which explicitly gives anyone and everyone <a title="see Sections 2 and 3" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">the right to publish it themselves</a>. (I was about to write “gives third parties the right,” until I realized that there are no third parties because there are no second parties. That’s kind of the point.)</p>
<p>This didn’t use to matter, because publishing on paper used to require a serious up-front investment in, well, paper. “Freedom of the press” was reserved for those with an actual press, and distribution costs were decidedly non-trivial. Publishing a book commercially just wasn’t practical for anyone but, well, a book publisher. That’s no longer the case. Copies can be purchased online, printed on demand, and drop-shipped to the customer — up-front investment be damned. And that’s for <em>printed</em> books; e-books are even easier.</p>
<p>Software had this problem first, by virtue of its non-corporeality. How many people are selling Free Software on eBay? We deride these sellers as “scammers,” but in truth the only time they run afoul of the law is when they attempt to rebrand your software without acknowledgement, or when they fail to abide by some other intentionally inside-out clause of the license that you chose in the first place (e.g. selling GPL’d binaries without offering source code).</p>
<p>Still, there’s a qualitative difference between letting people download your own work from your own site, and watching other people try to profit from it. But it is precisely this difference that strikes at the heart of the Free Software/Free Culture ethos. Part of choosing a Free license for your own work is accepting that people may use it in ways you disapprove of. There are no “field of use” restrictions, and there are no “commercial use” restrictions either. In fact, those are two of the fundamental tenets of the “Free” in Free Software. If “others profiting from my work” is something you seek to avoid, then Free Software is not for you. Opt for a Creative Commons “Non-Commercial” license, or a “personal use only” freeware license, or a traditional End User License Agreement. Free Software doesn’t have “end users.” That’s kind of the point.</p>
<p>The aforementioned Apress executive told me that he did not understand why I would be willing to work with a publisher but then be happy about their competition. This is what I told him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I enjoy working with publishers because it makes me a better writer. But I don’t write for money; I write for love (or passion, or whatever you want to call it). I choose open content licenses because this is the way I want the world to work, and the only way to change the world is to change yourself first.</p>
<p>I don’t know where that leaves you as a business. But you’ve made a good amount of money on the original “Dive Into Python,” despite the fact that it’s been available for free online for 8 years. A German translation of <a href="http://diveintopython3.org/">Dive Into Python 3</a> is being published this quarter by Springer/Germany [a division of Apress&#039; parent company] almost simultaneously with the English edition — much sooner-to-market than it would have been under a closed development process. (And <a href="http://gpiancastelli.altervista.org/dip3-it/">an Italian translation</a> was just released yesterday. You should snap that one up too before someone else does!) So maybe the problems you perceive are really opportunities in disguise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I am grateful for this anonymous soul who woke up one day and said to herself, “You know what I should do today? I should try to sell copies of that Free book that Pilgrim wrote.” Grateful, because it afforded me the opportunity to remind myself why I chose a Free license in the first place. My Zen teacher once told me that, when people try to do you harm, you should thank them for giving you the opportunity to forgive them. In this case it’s even simpler, because there’s nothing to forgive, just explain. She’s redistributing the work that I explicitly made redistributable. She’s kind of the point.</p>

		<p>CSS is a sticky subject in the best of times and to make it more sticky I thought I&#039;d run down the techniques needed to <strong>make a sticky footer that works in all modern browsers</strong>. This is unlike <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?source=ig&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=1G1GGLQ_ENUK317&amp;=&amp;q=CSS+Sticky+Footer+&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=lr%3D&amp;aq=f&amp;oq="><strong>most examples on the web</strong></a> that break in either Opera, IE8, IE7 or indeed in all three.</p>
<p>Try any of those footers from the Google search above in IE8 or Opera (some don&#039;t work in IE7 either). Load the page then grab the bottom of the window (not the side or corner of the window) and drag it up or down and you will see that the footer usually sticks in the wrong place, messing up the display.</p>
<p>Now try it on <a href="http://www.pmob.co.uk/temp/3colfixedtest_4.htm"><strong>my old original sticky footer version</strong></a> (circa 2003 which pre-dates all those above) and you will see that my version is working in all browsers including IE8.</p>
<p>Before we get into details I should first explain what a sticky footer is.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pmob.co.uk/temp/sticky-footer-ie8new.htm">What is a Sticky Footer</a></strong></p>
<p>A sticky footer is one that sits at the bottom of the viewport when there is not enough content in the page to push the footer down. If there is a lot of content then the footer sits at the bottom of the document and will be below the fold as usual. Why this is desirable is because on short content pages you won&#039;t have a footer right at the top of the screen looking very strange indeed as shown from Figure 1 below.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1</strong> - normal footer close to content.<br>
<img src="http://www.search-this.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/f1-300x84.png" alt="Normal footer" title="Normal footer" width="300" height="84" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-973"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 2</strong> - Sticky footer at bottom of viewport.<br>
<img src="http://www.search-this.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/f2-300x252.png" alt="f2" title="f2" width="300" height="252" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-977"></p>
<p>Note that a &quot;<strong>fixed positioned</strong>&quot; footer is not the same thing as a sticky footer as a fixed positioned footer is one that sits at the bottom of the viewport at all times and never moves. Don&#039;t get confused between the two.</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>Before we get into the nitty gritty detail I will briefly explain the concept in getting a sticky footer to work.</p>
<p>The first thing we need to do is create a 100% high container which is achieved by setting the html and body elements to 100% height and then creating a container that is a minimum of 100% high. The footer is then placed after this container which means it will be invisible as it will be below the fold of the page but by the magic of negative margins we can bring it back into view at the bottom of the viewport.</p>
<p>Of course this means that the sticky footer must be a fixed height (pixels or ems will do) so that we know how to accommodate it with the exact negative margins that bring it into view. This also means that our footer is now overlapping content on the page so we will also need to protect this content with either padding on an inner element, or some other similar approach as you will see when we get into specifics later.</p>
<p>That&#039;s basically all there is to it except that we have to squash a few bugs on the way to make it work everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>When to use a Sticky Footer</strong></p>
<p>Sticky footers are best suited for fixed width sites with small copyright messages and horizontal menu links that keep the footer at a relatively small size. The technique will work with a large height footer but the chances are that if you have a very large footer it will always reach the bottom anyway by the time you&#039;ve got your header and content in place. It will also work with percentage width footers but remember that if the content in the footer is squeezed into making the footer higher than it was then the negative margin routine won&#039;t match any more and the layout will be misaligned slightly.</p>
<p><strong>Creating The Footer</strong></p>
<p>Now it&#039;s time to get your hands dirty with the code and I will break the method down in easy steps.</p>
<p>1) Create a 100% high wrapper to fill the viewport.</p>
<p>This is accomplished by removing the default margin and padding from the html and body elements and then setting a height of 100% so that our wrapper element can base its height on this. We then use min-height:100% on our page wrapper and not height:100% because our container would never grow otherwise but we will still need to address IE6 as it doesn&#039;t understand min-height at all. (If we didn&#039;t apply a height to html and body then our container would collapse to auto height and would not stretch to the bottom. The margins from html and body must also be removed because they would increase the height and thus ruin the effect as we want an exact 100% height only.)</p>

<p>As mentioned previously IE6 doesn&#039;t understand min-height therefore we provide a rule for IE6 only (using the <a href="http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/workaroundsfilters"><strong>star selector hack</strong></a> to target IE6 and under only) using the height property instead. We can do this because IE6 treats height as a minimum and will always expand an element to accommodate its content when overflow is set to visible (which is the default). We must also hide this height rule from other browsers because this would limit them to only an initial 100% and therefore the element would never expand with content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&#039;t be tempted to use the !important hack to provide the height property to IE6 because the routine causes IE7 to be buggy with 100% height and won&#039;t resize the footer when the viewport is resized vertically.<br>
i.e. <strong>Do not do this:</strong></p>

<p>Both the above <strong>will fail in IE7</strong> due to an obscure bug and should not be used in this routine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The result of this code is that we now have a container that stretches to 100% height of the viewport quite nicely but the footer is sitting under this element and therefore under the fold of the page.</p>
<p>To bring the footer into view we first have to give it an appropriated height and then using a negative margin we drag it back into view. The negative margin can be applied in either of the following three methods.</p>
<p>1) A negative <strong>top margin</strong> on the footer itself<br>
2) A negative <strong>bottom margin</strong> on the main wrapper<br>
3) A negative <strong>top margin</strong> on the main wrapper</p>
<p>The first two methods are basically the same and just cause the footer to slip up over the bottom of the wrapper by the appropriate amount. <strong>Remember that the negative margins must match exactly the height of the footer.</strong> As a consequence of pulling the footer upwards it may indeed overwrite any content that was above it so you would also need to add some padding to the content above. The padding couldn&#039;t be added to the main wrapper because that means it would be too high and therefore the padding must be added to an inner element instead or just added to the element above the footer.</p>
<p>The third method mentioned above uses a slightly different tack in that the whole wrapper is moved upwards with a negative margin thus allowing the footer to fall into view at the bottom of the viewport but with the consequence that our wrapper now starts above the top of the viewport and out of sight. We therefore need to soak up this space on an inner element much the same as we did with the other two methods.</p>
<p>In 99% of cases you will most likely have a header element at the top of your page and you can use this element to soak up the extra space. My preferred method is to use a solid border on top of the header to do this because unlike padding it would not interfere with any absolutely positioned children should there be any.</p>
<p>Assuming our footer is 40px high the code to accomplish this is shown below:</p>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>The top border soaks up the space that is above the viewport and allows content to start in the viewport where it should be. This is exactly what we wanted and is quite a slick way to do this as we no longer need to worry about any overlap of the footer.</p>

<p>With the code shown we are very close to have a working footer and indeed the code above will work in IE6/7 and Firefox with no problems. Try out the above and see for yourself.</p>
<p>The problem with the above code is that it doesn&#039;t work properly in IE8 or in Opera. If, as already mentioned, you move the window by grabbing the bottom of the viewport (not the side or the corner) then the footer becomes mis-positioned or doesn&#039;t move at all.</p>
<p>This is the behavior seen in all other sticky footers but it doesn&#039;t occur in my original demo. The clue to why my old demo is still working will provide us with a neat solution that can be wrapped into this specific footer routine.</p>
<p>Back in 2003 not many browsers understood min-height and to accommodate these browsers I used a min-height hack which was basically a 100% high float that was 1px (or even 0px) wide. This held the browser open to the initial 100% height quite nicely without affecting much else as long as we took clear of clearing issues. The 100% height float triggered opera into resizing the page correctly once the viewport was moved and caused the footer to be drawn into the correct position.</p>
<p>Today (and thanks to the <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/showthread.php?t=611825">quiz I set at sitepoint</a>) we can apply that 100% float using the pseudo element &quot;<a href="http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/pseudoelement-before">:before</a>&quot; and negate the need for any extra html mark up at all.</p>

</div>
<p>The code above places a 100% high float that has no width as the first element on the page. This enables Opera to resize nicely and keep the footer where it should be. To negate any possible clearing issues on normal page content we use a negative top margin to pull the float high above the viewport (32767px is Opera&#039;s limit so don&#039;t use any more than this). Even with the negative margin applied Opera still continues to resize the page nicely.</p>
<p><strong>IE8</strong></p>
<p>The last browser to address is IE8 as it won&#039;t play ball with this method although it does understand the pseudo element :before, it doesn&#039;t apply the 100% height to it as required. Therefore we need another fix and again the answer is quite simple and logical and we supply IE8 with <strong>height:100%</strong> but declare the element as <a href="http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/display">display:table</a>. This will enable the element to be 100% high initially but also to expand if content dictates which is exactly the way that tables work.</p>
<p>As IE8 is the only one that needs this rule we will use <a href="http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/conditionalcomments">conditional comments</a> to supply this rule to it. In order to tidy up we can also remove the IE6 hack we added earlier and put it in the conditional comments as shown below.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with the first line of the conditional comments shown above then in English it basically says &quot;<strong>If less than or equal to IE6 <strong>or</strong> If greater than or equal to IE8 then use the code below</strong>&quot;.</p>
<p>As IE6 doesn&#039;t understand display:table then it is simply ignored by IE6 and it gets the height:100% rule only. IE8 on the other hand understands both and gets both just as it needed. This saves using two sets of conditional comments and keeps the page nice and tidy.</p>

<p>I don&#039;t think you can get neater than that!</p>
<p>Although I have shown the example in a fixed-width format you can use it in a percentage or fluid width page as long as you take care with the footer dimensions and don&#039;t let the footer height increase with content. To enable text-resizing you could size the footer and negative margins using ems but that would assume you were basing them on the same font-size, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Things to watch out for</strong></p>
<p>Remember to take into account the effect of <a href="http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/collapsingmargins">collapsing margins</a> on the first and last elements in the wrapper because these may have an impact on the position of the parent or the position of the footer.</p>
<p>I also often see problems where authors have tried to make space at the top and bottom of the page by simply moving the wrapper down the page. The result of this is it moves the whole 100% down the page and ruins the effect. Everything has to happen in the 100% high wrapper and if you want space at the top then you would need to reduce the space at the bottom or be creative in other ways.</p>
<p>Here are just a few various examples.<br>

<p><i>Postscript:</i> I am not “against” extensibility, or distributed extensibility, or decentralized extensibility, or whatever we’re calling namespaces this week. I just think it’s funny that some people read this proposal and immediately jumped to <strong>The Glorious And Infinitely Extensible Semantic Web With Unicorns And Ponies</strong>, when it’s really just an attempt to get the HTML Working Group to bless a collection of Microsoft-proprietary technologies that they’ve jammed into Internet Explorer over the years.</p>

		<h2>Is technology really making a difference?</h2>
<p>Of course we all love our iPods and Blu-Ray players and doing research before Google came along was slow, often times requiring you to get in your car and go to a library. Anybody remember using library tools such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_catalog">card catalogs</a> and <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-microfiche.htm">Microfiche</a> to perform research? Now we can do it from our beds, simply by entering a few words into our mobile device and get instantaneous results; fantastic, no doubt.</p>
<p>Today&#039;s cell phones look like something out of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek">Star Trek</a>. Actually, they look better and have more options.</p>
<p>We truly live in marvelous times. But, what does it all add up to? Technology is supposed to make our lives easier, more productive and in some areas eliminate work altogether. And for the most part I think we can say it&#039;s worked. So how come I, like you, still work forty plus hour work weeks? In fact, since World War 2 the number of hours worked per week has grown. In her recent book, &quot;<em>Willing Slaves – How the Overwork Culture is Ruling our Lives</em>&quot;, Madeleine Bunting states that from 1977 to 1997 Americans working full time have increased their average working hours from 43.6 hours to 47.1 hours each week. (This does not include time required to travel to and from their places of business).<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work-life_balance">[1]</a> How can this be? In addition to working longer hours, many families have both family members working. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics states that between 1950 and 2000 the number of individuals in the active labor force grew 227 percent from 62 million to 141 million.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_time">[2]</a></p>
<p>The whole goal of a software developer is to make <em>someone&#039;s</em> life easier. If we&#039;re successful our software or device will allow a user to be more proficient, saving them time and allowing them to get more work done. But does it really matter if the user is now able to get their work done faster if the end result is still working forty hours? What does it matter if you can get twice the amount of work done? Forty hours is forty hours. I&#039;m sure that by increasing the amount of work we are able to get done each day that someone benefits, someone higher up, but it isn&#039;t you and it isn&#039;t me.</p>
<p>It seems like life just keeps moving at an ever accelerated pace. Like a merry-go-round that started off slow and built up speed. Perhaps it&#039;s moving so fast now that we can&#039;t jump off? Or maybe we still don&#039;t feel we need to jump off?</p>
<p>Author <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Quinn">Daniel Quinn</a> in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ishmael-Adventure-Spirit-Daniel-Quinn/dp/0553375407/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1251814631&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Ishmael</em></a> gives us a parable that may explain what has happened. It&#039;s certainly interesting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Terpsichore is among the places you would enjoy visiting in the universe. This was a planet where people emerged in the usual way in the community of life. For a time they lived as all others live, simply eating whatever came to hand. But after a couple of million years of living in this way, they noticed it was very easy to promote the regrowth of their favorite foods. You might say they found a few easy steps that would have this result. They didn&#039;t have to take these steps in order to stay alive, but if they took them, their favorite foods were always more readily available. These were, of course, the steps of a dance.</p>
<p>A few steps of the dance, performed just three or four days a month, enriched their lives greatly and took almost no effort. As here on earth, the people of this planet were not a single people but many peoples, and as time went on, each people developed its own approach to the dance. Some continued to dance just a few steps three or four days a month. Others found it made sense for them to have even more of their favorite foods, so they danced a few steps every second or third day. Still others saw no reason why they shouldn&#039;t live mostly on their favorite foods, so they danced a few steps every single day. Things went on this way for tens of thousands of years among the people of this planet, who thought of themselves as living in the hands of the gods and leaving everything to them. For this reason, they called themselves Leavers.</p>
<p>But one group of Leavers eventually said to themselves, &quot;Why should we just live partially on the foods we favor? Why don&#039;t we live entirely on the foods we favor? All we have to do is devote a lot more time to dancing.&quot; So this one particular group took to dancing several hours a day. Because they thought of themselves as taking their welfare into their own hands, we&#039;ll call them Takers. The results were spectacular. The Takers were inundated with their favorite foods. A manager class soon emerged to look after the accumulation and storage of surpluses — something that had never been necessary when everyone was just dancing a few hours a week. The members of this manager class were far too busy to do any dancing themselves, and since their work was so critical, they soon came to be regarded as social and political leaders. But after a few years these leaders of the Takers began to notice that food production was dropping, and they went out to see what was going wrong. What they found was that the dancers were slacking off. They weren&#039;t dancing several hours a day, they were dancing only an hour or two and sometimes not even that much. The leaders asked why.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#039;s the point of all this dancing?&quot; the dancers said. &quot;It isn&#039;t necessary to dance seven or eight hours a day to get the food we need. There&#039;s plenty of food even if we just dance an hour a day. We&#039;re never hungry. So why shouldn&#039;t we relax and take life easy, the way we used to do?&quot;</p>
<p>The leaders saw things very differently, of course. If the dancers went back to living the way they used to, then the leaders would soon have to do the same, and that didn&#039;t appeal to them at all. They considered and tried many different schemes to encourage or cajole or tempt or shame or force the dancers into dancing longer hours, but nothing worked until one of them came up with the idea of locking up the food.</p>
<p>&quot;What good will that do?&quot; he was asked.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason the dancers aren&#039;t dancing right now is that they just have to reach out and take the food they want. If we lock it away, they won&#039;t be able to do that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But if we lock the food away, the dancers will starve to death!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, you don&#039;t understand,&quot; the other said with a smile. &quot;We&#039;ll link dancing to receiving food — so much food for so much dancing. So if the dancers dance a little, they&#039;ll get a little food, and if they dance a lot, they&#039;ll get a lot. This way, slackers will always be hungry, and dancers who dance for long hours will have full stomachs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They&#039;ll never put up with such an arrangement,&quot; he was told.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#039;ll have no choice. We&#039;ll lock the food away in storehouses, and the dancers will either dance or they&#039;ll starve.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The dancers will just break into the storehouses.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We&#039;ll recruit guards from among the dancers. We&#039;ll excuse them from dancing and have them guard the storehouses instead. We&#039;ll pay them the same way we pay the dancers, with food — so much food for so many hours of guarding.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It will never work,&quot; he was told. But oddly enough it did work...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here we are today, dancing away and no amount of technology seems to matter. We keep creating better and better technology and yet we dance more and more.</p>
<p>I love being a software developer. I love coming up with creative solutions to peoples problems. Over the past ten years I have been fortunate enough to work on a variety of projects ranging from POS software, market analysis software, life and health insurance software and educational school system software. For the most part the feedback has been positive. But I&#039;ve yet to have anyone say &quot;thanks to your software I am now able to spend more time with my family.&quot; In the end I don&#039;t know that I have made anyone&#039;s life better. I may have allowed them to get more work done in a day by speeding up their processes. I may have simplified their work life and improved their experience, but have I made their life any better?</p>
<p>&quot;I submit that Egyptian workers, relatively speaking, got as much out of building Khufu’s pyramid as Microsoft workers will get out of building Bill Gates’s pyramid (which will surely dwarf Khufu’s a hundred times over, though it will not, of course, be built of stone).&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It took Khufu twenty-three years to build his Great Pyramid at Giza, where some eleven hundred stone blocks, each weighing about two and a half tons, had to be quarried, moved, and set in place every day during the annual building season, roughly four months long. Few commentators on these facts can resist noting that this achievement is an amazing testimonial to the pharaoh’s iron control over the workers of Egypt. I submit, on the contrary, that pharaoh Khufu needed to exercise no more control over his workers at Giza than pharaoh Bill Gates exercises over his workers at Microsoft.&quot;</p>
<p>Throughout time man has asked - Who are we? Where did we come from and where are we going? Perhaps these questions are more pertinent now more than ever...</p>

		<p>jQuery, a lightweight (only 19kb in size) JavaScript library has become my new best friend. It&#039;s like mushrooms to Mario. Obviously I&#039;m not alone since Microsoft is now distributing jQuery with Visual Studio (including jQuery intellisense). If you are using the new MVC framework from Microsoft then you will no doubt become familiar with the intricate workings of jQuery.</p>
<p>jQuery is not all that difficult to learn. The biggest thing you have to understand is all the different &quot;<a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors">selectors</a>&quot; that are available to you. Using <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Selectors">selectors</a> developers can query, in a CSS like way, for HTML elements, and then apply &quot;commands&quot; to them.</p>
<p>For example, the below JavaScript uses jQuery to find a &lt;div&gt; element within a page that has a CSS id of &quot;rightSide&quot;, and shows it and &quot;leftSide&quot; and hides it.</p>
<div class="igBar"><span id="ljavascript-27"><a href="http://www.search-this.com" onclick="javascript:showPlainTxt('javascript-27'); return false;">PLAIN TEXT</a></span></div>
<div class="syntax_hilite"><span class="langName">JAVASCRIPT:</span>
<div class="javascript" id="javascript-27">
<ol>
<li class="c5">
<div class="c4">$<span class="c1">(</span><span class="c2">&#039;div#rightSide&#039;</span><span class="c1">)</span>.<span class="c3">show</span><span class="c1">(</span><span class="c1">)</span>;</div>
</li>
<li class="c6">
<div class="c4">$<span class="c1">(</span><span class="c2">&#039;div#leftSide&#039;</span><span class="c1">)</span>.<span class="c3">hide</span><span class="c1">(</span><span class="c1">)</span>;</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>As another example, the JavaScript below uses jQuery to find a specific &lt;table&gt; on the page with an id of &quot;datagrid1&quot;, then retrieves every other &lt;tr&gt; row within the datagrid, and sets those &lt;tr&gt; elements to have a CSS class of &quot;even&quot; - which could be used to alternate the background color of each row:</p>
<div class="igBar"><span id="ljavascript-28"><a href="http://www.search-this.com" onclick="javascript:showPlainTxt('javascript-28'); return false;">PLAIN TEXT</a></span></div>
<div class="syntax_hilite"><span class="langName">JAVASCRIPT:</span>
<div class="javascript" id="javascript-28">
<ol>
<li class="c5">
<div class="c4">$<span class="c1">(</span><span class="c2">&#039;#datagrid1 tr:nth-child(even)&#039;</span><span class="c1">)</span>.<span class="c3">addClass</span><span class="c1">(</span><span class="c2">&#039;even&#039;</span><span class="c1">)</span>;</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>This next example gets all links &lt;a&gt; in a specific &lt;div&gt; and attaches an onclick event to them:</p>
<div class="igBar"><span id="ljavascript-29"><a href="http://www.search-this.com" onclick="javascript:showPlainTxt('javascript-29'); return false;">PLAIN TEXT</a></span></div>
<div class="syntax_hilite"><span class="langName">JAVASCRIPT:</span>
<div class="javascript" id="javascript-29">
<ol>
<li class="c5">
<div class="c4">$<span class="c1">(</span><span class="c2">&#039;#navBtns a&#039;</span><span class="c1">)</span>.<span class="c3">bind</span><span class="c1">(</span><span class="c2">&#039;click&#039;</span>, <span class="c7">function</span><span class="c1">(</span>event<span class="c1">)</span><span class="c1">{</span></div>
</li>
<li class="c6">
<div class="c4">     event.<span class="c3">preventDefault</span><span class="c1">(</span><span class="c1">)</span>; <span class="c8">//stop the link from going to href</span></div>
</li>
<li class="c5">
<div class="c4">     <span class="c8">//do something</span></div>
</li>
<li class="c6">
<div class="c4"><span class="c1">}</span><span class="c1">)</span>;</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>Being able to traverse the DOM and locate HTML elements to attach events, behaviors, animations and CSS is priceless. But what about ASP.NET controls like the RadioButtonList, GridView, ListView, Repeater, and many others that we as developers like to bind to? How do we traverse them when they all get their ids auto-generated? That&#039;s what we will look at now! And with jQuery it&#039;s not that hard!</p>
<p>When you add an ASP.NET RadioButtonList control to a page, like below:</p>
<div class="igBar"><span id="lcsharp-30"><a href="http://www.search-this.com" onclick="javascript:showPlainTxt('csharp-30'); return false;">PLAIN TEXT</a></span></div>
<div class="syntax_hilite"><span class="langName">C#:</span>
<div class="csharp" id="csharp-30">
<ol>
<li class="c5">
<div class="c4">&lt;asp:RadioButtonList runat=<span class="c9">&quot;server&quot;</span> ID=<span class="c9">&quot;rblCaseControl&quot;</span> /&gt;</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>The browser renders the control to the code below:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.search-this.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/radioButtonListScreenshot.png" alt="radioButtonList screenshot" title="radioButtonListScreenshot" width="896" height="290" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-883"></p>
<p>As you can see, we don&#039;t have control over the generated items id tag. It would not be an easy task to guess what the auto-generated id tags are going to be. There&#039;s simply too many ways it can very depending on if you are using master-pages and or web-controls. The one thing that we do know is that somewhere in the id will be the id we gave to the control; in this case &quot;rblCaseControl&quot;. Lucky for us this is all jQuery needs to go to town. Look at the code below:</p>
<div class="igBar"><span id="ljavascript-31"><a href="http://www.search-this.com" onclick="javascript:showPlainTxt('javascript-31'); return false;">PLAIN TEXT</a></span></div>
<div class="syntax_hilite"><span class="langName">JAVASCRIPT:</span>
<div class="javascript" id="javascript-31">
<ol>
<li class="c5">
<div class="c4"><span class="c7">var</span> rblCaseControl = $<span class="c1">(</span><span class="c2">&#039;input[type=radio][id*=rblCaseControl]&#039;</span><span class="c1">)</span>;</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>This code uses jQuery to get all radio buttons that have &quot;rblCaseControl&quot; somewhere in their id tag. We could get the selected value of the radio button list using this code:</p>
<div class="igBar"><span id="ljavascript-32"><a href="http://www.search-this.com" onclick="javascript:showPlainTxt('javascript-32'); return false;">PLAIN TEXT</a></span></div>
<div class="syntax_hilite"><span class="langName">JAVASCRIPT:</span>
<div class="javascript" id="javascript-32">
<ol>
<li class="c5">
<div class="c4"><span class="c7">var</span> rblCaseControl = $<span class="c1">(</span><span class="c2">&#039;input[type=radio][id*=rblCaseControl]:checked&#039;</span><span class="c1">)</span>.<span class="c3">val</span><span class="c1">(</span><span class="c1">)</span>;</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>With this code we have now found the selected value from our ASP.NET RadioButtonList control using jQuery. Perhaps now we want to send that value to a web method in our codebind page using Ajax? Well we could use jQuery for that too! But, that&#039;s another article.</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/tabular-data.html#table-descriptions">
<p>For tables that consist of more than just a grid of cells with headers in the first row and headers in the first column, and for any table in general where the reader might have difficulty understanding the content, authors should include explanatory information introducing the table. This information is useful for all users, but is especially useful for users who cannot see the table, e.g. users of screen readers.</p>
<p>Such explanatory information should introduce the purpose of the table, outline its basic cell structure, highlight any trends or patterns, and generally teach the user how to use the table.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways to include this information, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>In prose, surrounding the table</li>
<li>In the table’s caption</li>
<li>In the table’s caption, in a details element</li>
<li>Next to the table, in the same figure</li>
<li>Next to the table, in a figure’s legend</li>
</ul>
<p>Authors may also use other techniques, or combinations of the above techniques, as appropriate.</p>
<p>If a table element has a summary attribute, the user agent may report the contents of that attribute to the user.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to be the one to have to explain this to you, but nobody else is doing so, so here goes: The W3C process doesn’t actually require that working groups agree, or not contradict each other. The WAI’s mission is not binding on other working groups.</p>

By most measures, he was nondescript: a youngish white man in jeans, a long-sleeved T-shirt and a Washington Nationals baseball cap. From a small case, he removed a violin. Placing the open case at his feet, he shrewdly threw in a few dollars and pocket change as seed money, swiveled it to face pedestrian traffic, and began to play.&quot;</em></p>
<p>This scene is all too familiar for those of us that work in an urban downtown area. Do we stop and listen or just hurry on about our business?</p>
<p>But wait, this was not your typical panhandler. No one knew it, but the fiddler standing against a bare wall was one of the finest classical musicians in the world. In fact, the musician was Joshua Bell. Whom just three days before he appeared at the Metro station, had filled the house at Boston&#039;s stately Symphony Hall, where merely pretty good seats went for $100. The very violin that he played was worth more than most of the passer byes would make in their lifetime. The violin was handcrafted in 1713 by Antonio Stradivari and the price tag was reported to be about $3.5 million.</p>
<p>Joshua Bell, one of the worlds top classical musicians, equipped with his million dollar Stradivari violin played one of the most difficult violin pieces ever. <strong>AND THE WORLD WAS TOO BUSY TO NOTICE...</strong></p>
<p>This experiment arranged by The Washington Post struck a cord in me. Probably because I fear that I would be one of the many that was too busy with life to see or hear the beauty that was right there in front of me.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons for the less frequency of blog post these days. The other reason is the birth of my second child. In the words of Ferris Bueller, &quot;Life moves pretty fast. If you don&#039;t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.&quot;</p>
<p>The life of a software developer is fast paced for sure, maybe that&#039;s why they call them sprints in the Agile dev methodology. Make sure you are stopping from time to time to smell the roses or hear the music. Work to live. Don&#039;t live to work...</p>

		<p>In this short article we will use jQuery to produce this <strong><a href="http://www.search-this.com/examples/drop-down-menu/" target="_blank">dropdown menu</a></strong>. Over the past six months I have been using a lot of jQuery and have fallen in love with it. For those not familiar with jQuery it is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development. All this and for only 19KB! How nice is that? They claim that, &quot;jQuery will change the way that you write JavaScript.&quot; And they are right. Companies such as Google, Dell, Bank of America, Major League Baseball, Digg, NBC, CBS, Netflix, Technorati, WordPress, Drupal, Mozilla and many others use jQuery too. Ok, that&#039;s enough of a plug, let&#039;s look at the code:</p>

<p>This gets the class <em>.down-list</em> and sets its width equal to the width of the <em>.dropdown-menu&#039;s</em> width minus two. As you may already know or were able to deduce the dollar sign ($) is used to select HTML elements in the page. The $ method accepts a CSS selector(s) as argument(s), so if you want to select a specific element by it&#039;s id or it&#039;s class as in the case here you can use the $(&quot;#myElementId&quot;) code which returns a reference to the DOM element. Learning all the jQuery selectors is very important in mastering jQuery, but is not the scope of this article.</p>

<p>This code attaches the hover event to all <em>.dropdown-menu</em> classes. Short and sweet. The <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Events/hover">hover</a> event uses two functions: over and out. Whenever the mouse cursor is moved over a matched element, the first specified function is fired. Whenever the mouse moves off of the element, the second specified function fires.</p>

<p>The first function is called when someone mouses over a dropdown menu. It adds the class <em>slide-down</em> to the menu and then animates it by <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Effects/slideDown">sliding down</a>. The 100 in the slideDown method is the speed of the animation measured in milliseconds.</p>
<p>The second function is called when they mouse out. The part to notice here is the additional function in the <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Effects/slideUp">slideUp</a> method. This is a callback function; it fires when the animation is complete. So in this case when the user mouses off our dropdown menu it will animate up and then remove the class <em>slide-down</em>. And that will wrap up our dropdown menu.</p>
<p>As you can see, very little code to achieve this common web effect thanks to jQuery.</p>

		<p>In this article you will learn how to send email using ASP.NET. Yes, there are plenty of other articles that cover sending email via .NET, but after spending a day doing research, I was amazed at how many articles failed to provide either a correct solution or a real world example. I found that many articles suggest you create your HTML email by using a string with the HTML markup in it. That&#039;s crazy and not at all a real world solution, at least not for most situations. In this article we will look at a more realistic solution. One in which we use a regular HTML file as our template for the email. The template file will be a standard HTML file with the exception of some placeholders that we will use to populate our content and images right before we send the email. Think mail-merge in Microsoft Word. Finally, we will also learn how to send the email in such a way that if the email recipient&#039;s mail-client can&#039;t render HTML they will get an alternate plain text version.</p>
<p>Let&#039;s start by looking at the code in its entirety; the people that just want to grab the code and use it can do so. I will then explain the code.</p>

<p>The kicker and not well documented part to note is the from=&quot;admin@company.com&quot; in the smtp tag. You can change the from address later, but the <strong>MailDefinition</strong> class needs this here.</p>
<p>That&#039;s it for setup. Now let&#039;s look at the first chunk of code.</p>

<p>In this example they have the option of sending the email to more than one recipient. So we perform a check on the four optional text-boxes to see if they have email addresses and if they are not empty then we add them to our <strong>MailMessage</strong> instance. In addition, we append them to our <strong>StringBuilder</strong> instance which we will end up using later.</p>

<p>Here we simply create a string which we&#039;ll use as our plain-text email message. But remember, we only want to use the plain-text version of the email if their mail client does not support HTML. Therefore we use the <strong>AlternateView</strong> class and add it to our <strong>MailMessage</strong> instance. We could have chosen not to use the alternate view and just made it the body of our <strong>MailMessage</strong> instance, but not this time.</p>
<p>That&#039;s it for the plain-text version, now we will handle the HTML version.</p>

<p>Notice we use the <strong>MailDefinition</strong> class this time and not the <strong>MailMessage</strong> class as we did with the plain-text version. That&#039;s because it&#039;s the <strong>MailDefinition</strong> class that allows us to to create an email from an HTML file. Notice the <em>BodyFileName</em> property that we have set to our &quot;email.htm&quot; file. This is just a regular old HTML file. Lastly, we set the <em>IsBodyHtml</em> property to true.</p>

<p>The above code adds two images to the HTML file. The <strong>EmbeddedMailObject</strong> represents an item to embed in a mail message. Notice the <em>Name</em> property. This is important because in our HTML file (email.htm) we have this <strong>&lt;img src=&quot;cid:hdr&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;</strong> code which is where it maps to the image. This way of adding images to our <strong>MailDefinition</strong> object will send the images with the email. If you don&#039;t wish to send images with your email you may choose to simply add absolute paths to your images in your HTML file like normal. Just make sure the paths are absolute.</p>

<p>This is an important part. This is where we pass in fields to our HTML template. Within our HTML file we find this <strong>&lt;%EVENTDATE%&gt;</strong> . This is a placeholder that we use to pass in content. Pretty cool eh? Almost like a mail-merge in Word. So all the above gets mapped into our HTML template. Now we see the power of this solution. It sure beats creating a huge string. We have a regular old HTML file with the placeholders that we pass in the content. Any future changes can be done right in the HTML file. Nice...</p>

<p>The <strong>CreateMailMessage</strong> method creates the email message and does the merging of our <em>replacement</em> list with the placeholders. We also pass in the string that we created earlier. Remember the string held all the email recipient addresses. The last parameter is looking for a control that owns the <strong>MailDefinition</strong>. We don&#039;t have one so we just pass in a dummy control.</p>
<p>All that remains is to send the email message via the smtp protocol. If everything in your <strong>Web.config</strong> file is set up correctly your email should be on the way.</p>

		<p>So this morning I thought I would take a look at some of the videos that showcase Windows 7. Maybe get excited about some of the new features, get my hopes up, why not? I went to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/beta-videos.aspx">their website</a> but CAN&#039;T view the videos!</p>
<p>First I get the, &quot;<strong>Additional plugins are required to display all the media on this page.</strong>&quot; bar, which is not a problem in and of itself. I realize I need to get the Silverlight plugin. So I try to do so and get this <a href="http://www.search-this.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/win7b.gif"><strong>error message</strong></a>.</p>

		<p>The Internet has now surpassed all media except television as a news source, according to consumers surveyed in December 2008 by the <em>Pew Research Center for the People and the Press</em>.</p>
<p>In December 2008, 40% of respondents said they got most of their news about national and international issues from the Internet, up from just 24% in September 2007.</p>
<p>Pew said it was the <strong>first time since it started surveying that consumers relied more on the Internet for news than on newspapers</strong>.</p>
<p>Television was still the main source for national and international news, at 70%.</p>

<p>For young people, however, the Internet now rivals TV as a news source. Nearly six out of 10 Americans younger than 30 said they got most of their national and international news online; the exact same percentage said TV was the main way they got their news.</p>

<p>Stephane Grenier was kind enough to send me a copy of his new book <strong><a href="http://www.blogblazers.com/">Blog Blazers - 40 Top Bloggers Share Their Secrets</a></strong>. I&#039;m glad he did, it&#039;s a very enjoyable read. It&#039;s a lot like what the <strong><a href="http://www.search-this.com/random-bits/">Random Bits</a></strong> podcast offers its listeners. In fact the book interviews both <strong><a href="http://www.search-this.com/2008/01/28/random-bits-podcast-with-jonathan-snook-part-1/">Jonathan Snook</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.search-this.com/2008/01/28/random-bits-podcast-with-jonathan-snook-part-1/">Yaro Starak</a></strong> which have been interviewed here before on the Random Bits podcast. You&#039;ll also find interviews with notables like Seth Godin, Neil Patel, David Seah and 35 other top bloggers.</p>
<p>The books main goal is to provide you and your blog some insight into what it takes to be successful. Reminding you that &quot;A new blog comes online every 1.4 seconds&quot; it sure doesn&#039;t hurt to learn from some of the most successful bloggers to date.</p>
<p>In Blog Blazers, you&#039;ll learn the secrets of 40 top bloggers, as they all weigh in on such questions as:</p>
<p>- What&#039;s your best tip for writing a successful blog post?<br>

Yep it’s that time of the year again, time to go shopping for that special geek you love. Here are a handful of gifts any geek is sure to love.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102768">ATI Radeon HD 4870-X2 DDR5 2GB PCI-Express x16</a></h2>

<p>This video card is smoking fast. Right now it’s the fastest card on the market. Pick up one of these, or two in crossfire mode and play Call of Duty 4 and feel like you’re right there in the action! I have one on my new rig and oh man does it make CoD4 look great!</p>

<h2><a href="http://pc.ign.com/objects/818/818215.html">Left 4 Dead</a></h2>

<p>For starters it’s Valve. Not enough? Well you get to kill Zombies! That’s always fun. Lots and lots of zombies. And you can play in co-op mode with 3 of your buddies. Setting out to do for co-op gaming what Counter-Strike did for team combat, Left 4 Dead is an ambitious survival horror game. Running on the Source engine, Left 4 Dead leaves four armed survivors of a world overrun with zombies, and they must fight their way out to escape the outbreak. It’s a blast. It’s like I’m Will Smith in <em>I am Legend</em>.</p>

<p>“Kirk to bridge, someone………has…….stolen my……..chair.” And for the right price, that person can be you. Trekkies across the globe practically drowned in their own geekdom when it was first reported that Diamond Select, a popular sci-fi and comic toy store, was planning on releasing a life-sized Original Series captain’s chair for purchase.</p>

<p>I spoke to you back in January about <a href="http://www.search-this.com/2008/01/02/lijit-is-cool/">Lijit</a>. Remember I showed you that Lijit allows you to easily create your own search engine. One that searches your blog, bookmarks, photos, blogroll, and more.</p>
<p>I really liked Lijit then but I was disappointed that I couldn&#039;t integrate the Lijit search functionality into WordPress. That is let Lijit take over my search box that was already there and is ALREADY there in just about every other blog too. Instead you had to put a widget on your page. I felt like this was such a mistake I actually went to visit Lijit in Boulder and told them so. Well I&#039;m happy to say that they have listened and now allow you to let their search take over your search box. Here&#039;s what they say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lijit&#039;s integration with WordPress.org just keeps getting better! Now you can either install the Lijit Search widget OR have Lijit power your existing WordPress search box. As if that weren’t exciting enough, our Lijit stats will automatically display within your WordPress dashboard for one-stop stats viewing too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Go ahead and have a look, try the search located in the top left corner....</p>
<p>If you like it you can find the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-lijit-wijit/">Lijit WordPress plugin here</a>.</p>

They have created some really nice reference sheets for just about everything web related: Ajax, C#, ASP.NET, Springs, PHP, Java, Struts, IntelliJ IDEA, Design Patterns, jQuery Selectors, CSS and many more.</p>
<p>Each sheet is done by a respected professional in that discipline -- Jon Skeet, author of <em>C# in Depth</em> did the C# sheet and Molly Holzschlag, author of <em>The Zen of CSS Design</em> did the CSS sheet. Of course these sheets aren&#039;t intended to teach you, but simply there to aid you in those things that you usually end up looking up.</p>
<p>So far I have downloaded the C#, ASP.NET and jQuery sheets. They&#039;re handy and they&#039;re free, what else do you need to know than that. Enjoy.</p>

<p>After seven years of being a software developer I have finally done it - I&#039;ve joined a web agency! On November 3rd I will be joining <a href="http://www.mbarnhart.com/"><strong>Malenke | Barnhart</strong></a> here in Denver. I&#039;m pretty excited about it. It looks like a real fun place to work, Xbox 360 on down time, dress however you want and drink beer on Fridays. All while producing incredible top quality work. Here is some of their work:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.denver.org/">Denver.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.compareford.com/regionSelector.php">Ford</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.denverzoo.org/">Denver Zoo</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.howmuchshakecanyoutake.com/">Quiznos</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.girlscoutsofcolorado.org/">Girl Scouts</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So for those of you that have worked for an agency before, do you have any advice for me?</p>

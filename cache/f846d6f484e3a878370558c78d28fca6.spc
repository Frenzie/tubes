<p>I was never a big player of video games growing up, but I&#8217;ve recently gotten engrossed in them by way of my children. My older son plays New Super Mario Bros. Wii with me. Having finished all the worlds together, I find myself going back and collecting the &#8220;Star Coins,&#8221; of which there are 3 on each level. Some are cleverly hidden, others are out in the open but difficult to get. Collecting them unlocks in-game hint movies, all of which are more easily playable on Youtube &#8212; <em>even my six-year-old son knows this</em> &#8212; but still, I spend hours collecting them, and he high-fives me whenever I unlock a new movie.</p>

<p>It pains me to think that he might grow up doing the same with his cubicle-mates around some future version of Ribbon Hero and some future version of Office, but I suspect that&#8217;s the direction we&#8217;re headed.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:2:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}s:36:"http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace";a:1:{s:4:"base";s:54:"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2010/03/03/microgames";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:54:"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2010/03/03/microgames";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:1;s:8:"xml_lang";s:2:"en";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:9:"

The process is a bit complicated, but (unlike most other Android phones) it does not rely on exploiting security holes. <a href="http://androidandme.com/2010/01/hacks/video-how-to-unlock-and-root-a-nexus-one/">Android and Me has a great tutorial</a>, so I won&#8217;t repeat the gory details here. The key is in step 1, the <code>fastboot oem unlock</code> command. This does two important things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Allows you to install custom &#8220;recovery&#8221; firmware (of which more in a moment).</li>
<li>Irrevocably voids your warranty. Seriously, this trips a &#8220;security&#8221; bit somewhere deep within the phone that <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=613842">no one has been able to reset</a>. Once you run <code>fastboot oem unlock</code>, your carrier will be able to tell that you did it, and they can (and most likely will) deny you service if you send your phone in for repair.</li>
</ol>

<p>(I am aware that there are other devices that give you root access from the get-go, but I find this an interesting compromise between the needs of carriers to reduce support costs and the desires of people like me to do whatever they want with their own computers. It&#8217;s not an ideal situation, but considering that the only way to root the G1 was to downgrade your OS to a vulnerable version and exploit a gaping security hole, the N1 is certainly a step in the right direction.)</p>

<p>The &#8220;recovery&#8221; firmware is what installs OS upgrades and other low-level packages. The built-in recovery firmware will only install packages signed by Google. Custom recovery firmwares remove this restriction, allowing you to install a multitude of custom OS packages (colloquially called &#8220;ROMs,&#8221; despite being read/write). I recommend <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=611829">Amon_RA&#8217;s recovery firmware</a>; the Android and Me link has installation details.</p>

<p>Once you have Amon_RA&#8217;s recovery firmware installed, you can install essentially anything on your Nexus One, including replacing the entire operating system. The custom recovery firmware also has a number of useful features, including low-level backup and restore functionality (called &#8220;NAND backup&#8221;) in case you install an bad custom ROM that crashes your phone.</p>

<p>The least invasive thing to install is <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=613812">Cyanogen&#8217;s N1 Addon</a>. This is not a full OS replacement; it simply installs the all-important <code>su</code> binary and a userland application called &#8220;Superuser Permissions,&#8221; which lets you manage which applications can have root access. Once Cyanogen&#8217;s N1 Addon is installed, you can search the Android Market for things that require root access. Three that I have installed right now:</p>

<ul>
<li>N1 Torch, which uses the camera flash bulb on the back of the phone as a super-bright flashlight. (Seriously, this alone is worth the hassle of rooting your phone.)</li>
<li>AdFree, which overwrites your phone&#8217;s <code>/etc/hosts</code> file to remove selected in-app and in-browser advertising.</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-wifi-tether/">Wireless Tether for Root Users</a>, which turns your phone into a wireless hotspot for your laptop or other computers.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to go further, you can install a complete OS replacement. I personally use <a href="http://forum.cyanogenmod.com/index.php?/topic/150-cyanogenmod-for-nexus-one-v5041-02272010/">Cyanogenmod</a>. Another solid contender is <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=614427">Enomther&#8217;s &#8220;TheOfficial&#8221; Nexus1</a>, which focuses on customizability. (Open the terminal app and run <code>expsetup</code>.) There are others, but I haven&#8217;t experimented with them.</p>

<p>The place to be to learn more about modding your Nexus One is the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=559">xda-developers forum</a>. Their <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=619153">adb/fastboot/bootloader/android 101 newbie guide</a> is essential reading; it explains all the terminology that modders use, as well as the most common <code>adb</code> and <code>fastboot</code> commands.</p>

(No, seriously, listening to just one of the acts is plenty to start with.) <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Philip+Glass/_/Act%2BIII%252C%2BScene%2B1%253A%2BTrial%252FPrison">Scene one in the third</a> is like a chant &#8212; mixing, blending, jumbling parts of

<blockquote>
<p>Bank robbery is punishable by twenty years in federal prison.
</blockquote>

<p>First, count in your head where the words, stresses, breaks, and &#8220;notes&#8221; are occurring.

<blockquote style="font-family:monospace;font-style:normal">
<p><b>BANK</b> · <b>ROB</b> · ber · y · is · <b>PUN</b> · ish · a · ble · <b>BY</b> · <b>TWEN</b> · ty · <b>YEARS</b> · in · <b>FED</b> · er · al · <b>PRIS</b> · on
</blockquote>

<p>Now listen to the emphasis in <em>my</em> phrasing, matching syllables loosely.

<blockquote style="font-family:monospace;font-style:normal">
<pre>

<p>Stacked vertically, phrases become chords, measures marking time like a foot tap.

<p>I just recently was sleeping on the couch, music playing. Could I have dreamt it?

<blockquote>
<p>Bank robbery is punishable by twenty years of lunatic madmen.
<p>The appendices of the CSS specification are carried everywhere with me.
<p>Bank robbery is punished
<p>Bank robbery
<p>But but but doubtlessly, that&#8217;s where it&#8217;s from: twenty years of familiar rhythm.

<p>Or, is there a simpler cause? Twenty years of hearing that piece, now <em>my</em> brain is rewired to hear music, carried everywhere with me.

<blockquote>
<p>Bank robbery is punishable by stresses, breaks, and federal prison.
</blockquote>

<p>But, doubtlessly, that&#8217;s where it&#8217;s from: Philip Glass&#8217; &#8220;Einstein on the Beach.&#8221;

<blockquote>

A bit of <abbr>URL</abbr>-hacking then led me to <a href="http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/">this introduction of the man himself</a>, which briefly describes his major works, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach">Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</a>, which I first read in a delightful Logical Systems class in college, and which will be the only book in my backpack when I get to <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/11/03/the-pursuit-of-happiness">step 7 in my pursuit of happiness</a>, though by then we need to be able to buy unencumbered <abbr>PDF</abbr>s of such things, because damn &#8212; and I mean this quite literally &#8212; that book is heavy. Seriously, Amazon pegs it at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Godel-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567">832 pages and 2.4 pounds</a>. That&#8217;s almost enough reason to buy a Kindle. <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/11/19/the-future-of-reading">Almost</a>.</p>

<p>Hofstadter also wrote a book called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamagical_Themas">Metamagical Themas</a>, which before that was the title of a column he wrote for <cite>Scientific American</cite> in the early 80s. His column was the successor to Martin Gardner&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner#Recreational_mathematics">Mathematical Games</a> column, which later served as the inspiration for several of my <a href="http://diveintomark.org/projects/classic/">early Free Software games</a>. &#8220;Metamagical Themas&#8221; is, of course, an anagram of &#8220;Mathematical Games,&#8221; a fact which I somehow missed until it was pointed out to me by a now-ex-girlfriend for whom Hofstadter was also a literary hero.</p>

<p>Eventually, the introduction led me to <a href="http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/extras.html">this page of &#8220;Hofstadteriana&#8221;</a>, which includes <a href="http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/autolipography.html">Autoportrait with Constraint</a> (written without the letter E &#8212; a feat <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/02/05/writing-with-ease">I have also attempted</a>), <a href="http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/imagegallery.html">a selection of ambigrams</a> (like optical illusions, but with words), and <a href="http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/potpourri.html">this potpourri of other random excerpts</a>. This essay about <a href="http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/excerpts.html#gebxx">what <abbr>GEB:EGB</abbr> is really all about</a> is interesting, too.</p>

<p>(Good writing, bad writing, great writing, and the differences between them, <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/03/24/x">is something I&#8217;ve discussed here before</a>. But the letter to the editor described in <a href="http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/potpourri.html#meta">For Meta, For Verse</a> just makes me want to throw away everything I&#8217;ve ever written and <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2010/02/23/simplicity-is-hard-lets-go-shopping#comment-13827">go live in a wooden hut</a>. Let me put it another way. On a good day, Techcrunch is bad writing. On a bad day, I strive for at least good writing. But what Douglas does is&#8230; something else altogether. That poem is proof.)</p>

<p>After reading about &frac34; of the introduction page, I noticed that the first word of every paragraph was bolded, and furthermore that the last letter of every paragraph was italicized. Aha! The game is afoot! My suspicions were confirmed shortly thereafter. The initial bolded letters of each paragraph spell out &#8220;D-O-U-G-L-A-S-R-H-O-F-S-T-A-D-T-E-R,&#8221; which spells &#8220;Douglas R. Hofstadter.&#8221; But the final italicized letters of each paragraph seemed to spell out nothing at all: &#8220;l-a-s-i-p-a-n-y-e-h-t-r-o-w-n-e-l-g.&#8221; But of course! If the first letters spell something <em>forwards</em>, the final letters should spell something <em>backwards</em>. And so they do: they spell &#8220;Glen Worthey napisal.&#8221; Checking the page footer confirmed that the entire text was indeed written by one Glen Worthey, and as best as I can tell, &#8220;napisal&#8221; is a Polish word meaning &#8220;author&#8221; or &#8220;authored.&#8221; Glen Worthey wrote this. Aha!</p>

<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/214/">Meanwhile</a>, a bit closer to home, <a href="http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20100211#l-939">I recently learned</a> that the appendices of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/#minitoc">the CSS 2.1 specification</a> are in alphabetical order. I&#8217;m going to repeat that because it&#8217;s doubly awesome: <em>the appendices of the CSS specification are in alphabetical order</em>. &#8220;Appendix A. Aural style sheets,&#8221; &#8220;Appendix B. Bibliography,&#8221; &#8220;Appendix C. Changes.&#8221; Hmm, could be a coincidence. &#8220;Appendix D. Default style sheet for HTML 4.&#8221; Suspicious, but plausible. &#8220;Appendix E. Elaborate description of Stacking Contexts.&#8221; OK, now you&#8217;re just fucking with me. And so on, up until &#8220;Appendix I. Index.&#8221; (But, even more interestingly, not including Appendix H (!), which is absent from both the &#8220;mini-TOC&#8221; and the full table of contents, but which <em>is</em> present within the text of the specification itself, for example by going to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/indexlist.html">Appendix I</a> and clicking &#8220;previous.&#8221;)</p>

<p>Early on, I had tried to do something similar while writing <a href="http://diveintopython3.org/">Dive Into Python 3</a>. Unfortunately for fans of constrained writing everywhere (both of you), the constant rearranging, merging, adding, and removing chapters led me to abandon that effort. But learning about the easter egg in the CSS spec prompted me to try again, and now if you skim through the online edition, you&#8217;ll see that the initial drop caps in each chapter are in alphabetical order from A to U. Maybe it&#8217;s not Hofstadterian, but I&#8217;ll be damned if I&#8217;m going to be outdone by <em>the appendices of the CSS specification</em>. Still, if the pen is mightier than the sword, I feel like I&#8217;m still learning how to unsheath the damn thing and wave it around. And Douglas R. Hofstadter is a level 60 samurai.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:2:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}s:36:"http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace";a:1:{s:4:"base";s:61:"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2010/02/24/the-game-is-afoot";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:61:"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2010/02/24/the-game-is-afoot";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:1;s:8:"xml_lang";s:2:"en";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:9:"

This, for instance, is an actual conversation I had with my wife last fall:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Herself: What do you want for your birthday?</p>
<p>Myself: Nothing.</p>
<p>Her: You&#8217;re impossible to shop for.</p>
<p>Me: Actually, I want less than that. I want you to let me sell my car and replace it with nothing.</p>
<p>Her: Be realistic. We live in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Me: I have a bike.</p>
<p>Her: But what if my van breaks down?</p>
<p>Me: We have AAA.</p>
<p>Her: It would still put a huge burden on me if we only had one vehicle.</p>
<p>Me: That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s called a &#8220;gift.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her: You&#8217;re getting restaurant gift cards. And socks.</p>
<p>Me: I don&#8217;t need socks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apropos of nothing, I would just like to point out that the title of this post is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowclone">snowclone</a>, which itself is a word that I learned in the process of researching the exact wording of the original phrase of which it is a snowclone (&#8220;Math is hard. Let&#8217;s go shopping!&#8221; from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie#Controversies">Teen Talk Barbie</a> circa 1992). Not knowing whether I should write &#8220;simplicity is hard&#8221; or &#8220;simplicity is tough,&#8221; I searched Google for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;q=%22let's+go+shopping%22+math+barbie">&#8220;let&#8217;s go shopping&#8221; math barbie</a>, and the first result was a Language Log article called <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002892.html">Tracking snowclones is hard. Let&#8217;s go shopping!</a> which is both self-referential in the obvious sense, and also wonderfully meta-referential in that Language Log <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000350.html">was instrumental in coining the word &#8220;snowclone&#8221;</a> in the first place, but now can not possibly keep track of the snowclones, as seen by the lengthy update to that very post &#8220;added for those who find this via the Wikipedia entry for &#8217;snowclone&#8217;,&#8221; which would be&#8230; me. And damn it, now I&#8217;ve spent the last two hours on a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WikiWalk">wiki walk</a>. (And <em>now</em> I&#8217;ve (re)introduced you to TvTropes, so, you know, there goes your evening and most of your night. Try to come up for air before dawn.)</p>

<p>My point, such that I have one, is that simplicity is easy to describe but difficult to achieve. Especially (though not exclusively) when there are other people in your life. While I applaud <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/austria/7190750/Millionaire-gives-away-fortune-that-made-him-miserable.html">millionaires who decide to give away all their money</a> (I say &#8220;their&#8221; money instead of &#8220;his&#8221; money, since even if he made the bulk of it, I can&#8217;t imagine him being able to give it away without his wife&#8217;s consent), the reality at home is more droll. Take, for instance, the television in our bedroom. It is small, as televisions go, costing no more than $100. It was once hooked up to a <abbr>DVD</abbr> player, which itself cost less than $50. Our children used to congregate in our bedroom after bath and before bed and watch 10 or 15 minutes worth of a movie or Sesame Street or some similar passive entertainment. I say &#8220;used to,&#8221; because in truth they stopped doing that about a year ago. No particular reason, just changing patterns. I pointed out to my wife that this would be a perfect opportunity to simplify by getting rid of the television and replacing it with nothing. That conversation went something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Myself: Can we get rid of this television?</p>
<p>Herself: No.</p>
<p>Me: But we never use it anymore.</p>
<p>Her: I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s not true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I did what any self-respecting scientist would do when faced with an untested hypothesis: I devised a test. Which is to say, I unplugged it. The television. The power cord winds its way to a wall socket behind a dresser, which itself has to be moved in order to get at the socket, so my trickery was both non-obvious and difficult to counteract even if one should notice it. Which, of course, no one did. So there it sat, unused and unplugged, for over six months. Until one day, or rather one night, when we found ourselves in an old familiar situation &#8212; kids in pajamas, jumping on the bed, and so on &#8212; and my wife actually tried to pop in a <abbr>DVD</abbr>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Herself: The <abbr>TV</abbr> doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>Myself: I unplugged it.</p>
<p>Her: When?</p>
<p>Me: About six months ago.</p>
<p>Her: Why would you do that?</p>
<p>Me: To prove we never use it.</p>
<p>Her: I&#8217;m trying to use it right now.</p>
<p>Me: What are you hoping to accomplish?</p>
<p>Her: I need to calm the boys down.</p>
<p>Me: And this need has not arisen in the past six months?</p>
<p>Her: We usually read books.</p>
<p>Me: Why can&#8217;t we do that now?</p>
<p>Her: &#8230;</p>
<p>Me: Can we get rid of the television now?</p>
<p>Her: No, we might need it.</p>
<p>Me: OK, but I&#8217;m not plugging it back in.</p>
<p>Her: I hate you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>About five and a half months after that, which is to say about two weeks ago, I had <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/10/17/buying-art-online">bought some new art</a> and set about rearranging the walls to make everything fit. &#8220;Aha, an opportunity presents itself!&#8221; I thought to myself. You see, the (unplugged) television had always blocked a critical piece of real estate in our bedroom, above the dresser, in direct line of sight while lying in bed. The next morning, shortly after she had left the house to go to work, I disassembled the whole contraption, television and <abbr>DVD</abbr> player and all. I cleaned up an impressive amount of Assorted Random Crap that had accumulated around, behind, and beneath the television, I said goodbye to the final pile of physical discs in our house, and I hung one of my wife&#8217;s favorite pieces on the newly reclaimed wall in its place. When she came home, I gave her the grand tour of our newly rearranged walls, of course working up to the bedroom as the finale.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Herself: Yes! You finally got rid of that stupid television!</p>
<p>Myself: You know I unplugged it a year ago.</p>
<p>Her: Really? Why would you do that?</p>
<p>Me: It&#8217;s not important.</p>

<p>If that doesn&#8217;t make your heart skip a beat, you can stop reading now.</p>

<p>When I was growing up, &#8220;trespassing&#8221; was something you could only do to <em>other</em> people&#8217;s computers. But let&#8217;s set that aside and come back to it.</p>

<p>My father was a college professor for much of his adult life. One year, he took a sabbatical to write a book. He had saved up enough money to buy a computer and a newfangled thing called a word processing program. And he wrote, and he edited, and he wrote some more. It was so obviously better than working on a typewriter that he never questioned that it was money well spent.</p>

<p>As it happens, this computer came with the BASIC programming language pre-installed. You didn&#8217;t even need to boot a disk operating system. You could turn on the computer and press <kbd>Ctrl-Reset</kbd> and you&#8217;d get a prompt. And at this prompt, you could type in <em>an entire program</em>, and then type <kbd>RUN</kbd>, and it would motherfucking run.</p>

<p>I was 10. That was 27 years ago, but I still remember what it felt like when I realized that you &mdash; that <em>I</em> &mdash; could get this computer to do <em>anything</em> by typing the right words in the right order and telling it to <kbd>RUN</kbd> and it would motherfucking run.</p>

<p>That computer was an Apple ][e.</p>

<p>By age 12, I was writing BASIC programs so complex that the computer was running out of memory to hold them. By age 13, I was writing programs in Pascal. By age 14, I was writing programs in assembly language. By age 17, I was competing in the Programming event in the National Science Olympiad (and winning). By age 22, I was employed as a computer programmer.</p>

<p>Today I am a programmer, a technical writer, and a hacker in the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html">Hackers and Painters</a> sense of the word. But you don&#8217;t become a hacker by programming; you become a hacker by <em>tinkering</em>. It&#8217;s the tinkering that provides that sense of wonder. You have to jump out of the system, tear down the safety gates, peel away the layers of abstraction that the computer provides for the vast majority of people who don&#8217;t want to know how it all works. It&#8217;s about <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/08/22/c600g">using the Copy ][+ sector editor</a> to learn how the disk operating system boots, then modifying it so the computer makes a sound every time it reads a sector from the disk. Or displaying a graphical splash screen on startup before it lists the disk catalog and takes you to that BASIC prompt. Or copying a myriad of wondrous commands from the <a href="http://www.lazilong.com/apple_II/bbros/">Beagle Bros. Peeks &amp; Pokes Chart</a> and trying to figure out what the fuck I had just done. Just for the hell of it. Because it was fun. Because it scared my parents. Because I absolutely had to know how it all worked.</p>

<p>Later, there was an Apple IIgs. And later still, a Mac IIci. MacsBug. ResEdit. Norton Disk Editor. Stop me if any of this sounds familiar.</p>

<p>Apple made the machines that made me who I am. I became who I am by tinkering.</p>

<p>This post&#8217;s title is stolen from <a href="http://al3x.net/2010/01/28/ipad.html">Alex Payne&#8217;s &#8220;On the iPad,&#8221;</a> which I shall now quote at great length.</p>

<blockquote cite="http://al3x.net/2010/01/28/ipad.html">
<p>The iPad is an attractive, thoughtfully designed, deeply cynical thing. It is a digital consumption machine. As <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/01/27/iPad">Tim Bray</a> and <a href="http://createdigitalmusic.com/2010/01/27/how-a-great-product-can-be-bad-news-apple-ipad-and-the-closed-mac/">Peter Kirn</a> have pointed out, it&#8217;s a device that does little to enable creativity...</p>
<p>The tragedy of the iPad is that it truly seems to offer a better model of computing for many people &mdash; perhaps the majority of people. Gone are the confusing concepts and metaphors of the last thirty years of computing. Gone is the ability to endlessly tweak and twiddle towards no particular gain. The iPad is simple, straightforward, maintenance-free...</p>
<p>The thing that bothers me most about the iPad is this: if I had an iPad rather than a real computer as a kid, I&#8217;d never be a programmer today. I&#8217;d never have had the ability to run whatever stupid, potentially harmful, hugely educational programs I could download or write. I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to fire up ResEdit and edit out the Mac startup sound so I could tinker on the computer at all hours without waking my parents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I am aware that you will be able to develop your own programs for the iPad, the same way you can develop for the iPhone today. Anyone can develop! All you need is a Mac, XCode, an iPhone &#8220;simulator,&#8221; and <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/program/">$99 for an auto-expiring developer certificate</a>. The &#8220;developer certificate&#8221; is really a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">cryptographic key</a> that (temporarily) allows you (slightly) elevated access to... your own computer. And that&#8217;s fine &mdash; or at least workable &mdash; for the developers of today, because they already know that they&#8217;re developers. But the developers of tomorrow don&#8217;t know it yet. And without the <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/about">freedom to tinker</a>, some of them never will.</p>

<p>(As a side note, <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2009/11/21/living-in-a-browser">I was wrong</a> and <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2009/11/21/living-in-a-browser#comment-13567">Fredrik was right</a>, and Chrome OS devices <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/firmware-boot-and-recovery#Support_developers_l33t_users_">will have a switch for developers to run their own local code</a>. I don&#8217;t know the specifics of what it will look like, whether it will be a hardware button or switch or whatever. But it will be there, an officially supported mode for the developers of today and, more importantly, the developers of tomorrow.)</p>

<p>And I know, I know, I know you can &#8220;jailbreak&#8221; your iPhone, (re)gain root access, and run anything that can motherfucking run. And I have no doubt that someone will figure out how to &#8220;jailbreak&#8221; the iPad, too. But I don&#8217;t want to live in a world where <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/10/04/if-wishes-were-iphones">you have to break into your own computer</a> before you can start tinkering. And I certainly don&#8217;t want to live in a world where tinkering with your own computer is illegal. (DVD Jon was acquitted, by the way. <a href="http://w2.eff.org/effector/HTML/effect16.07.html#VI">The prosecutor appealed</a>, and he was acquitted again. But who needs the law when you have public key cryptography on your side?)</p>

<p>Once upon a time, Apple made the machines that made me who I am. I became who I am by tinkering. Now it seems they&#8217;re doing everything in their power to stop <em>my</em> kids from <a href="http://stevenf.com/beagle/legacy.html">finding that sense of wonder</a>. Apple has declared war on the tinkerers of the world. With every software update, the previous generation of &#8220;jailbreaks&#8221; stop working, and people have to find new ways to break into their own computers. There won&#8217;t ever be a MacsBug for the iPad. There won&#8217;t be a ResEdit, or a Copy ][+ sector editor, or an iPad Peeks &amp; Pokes Chart. And that&#8217;s a real loss. Maybe not to you, but to somebody who doesn&#8217;t even know it yet.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:2:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}s:36:"http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace";a:1:{s:4:"base";s:60:"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2010/01/29/tinkerers-sunset";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:60:"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2010/01/29/tinkerers-sunset";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:1;s:8:"xml_lang";s:2:"en";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:9:"

<p>I just spent an hour in Starbucks. (My kid is down the street at a Chinese class.) In the past hour, I&#8217;ve checked my email, read news, caught up on the HTML5 mailing lists and IRC chatter, paid two bills, balanced my checkbook, and written this post. Without leaving my browser.</p>

<p>So yeah, <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html">Google Chrome OS</a> is gonna be a hit.</p>

<p><del>Bummer about the whole &#8220;only runs apps <a title="If you don't own the master (key), the master owns you" href="http://www.google.com/search?&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;q=%22if+you+don't+own+the+master%22+lyrics">signed by a private key</a> that Google won&#8217;t be sharing with anyone&#8221; thing. I&#8217;m not thrilled about the prospect of working for a DRM company. Google was in the DRM business once before; it ended with <a href="http://googlewatch.eweek.com/content/google_video/google_admits_to_fixes_video_refund_gaffe.html">giving everyone their money back, twice</a>. And does anyone honestly believe the first Chrome OS machine won&#8217;t be jailbroken within a week?</del> Update: I&#8217;m getting conflicting reports about whether retail (non-developer) Chrome OS hardware will include a way to run unverified software. I&#8217;m locking this discussion thread until I can confirm this important detail.</p>

<p>On the other hand, computer maintenance sucks gargantuan donkey balls, and normal people don&#8217;t care about root. If you accost a random person on the street and ask them if they need root on their operating system to install another browser, and they&#8217;ll have three questions for you: 1. What&#8217;s root? 2. What&#8217;s an operating system? 3. <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/06/browser-is-search-engine.html">What&#8217;s a browser</a>?</p>

<p>Still&#8230; if I had root on a Linux netbook, the first thing I&#8217;d do is install Chromium and then spend 99% of my time in the browser. So I have to think that Chrome OS is a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>This is an open thread, but I won&#8217;t answer any questions on behalf of Google.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:2:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}s:36:"http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace";a:1:{s:4:"base";s:63:"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2009/11/21/living-in-a-browser";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:63:"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2009/11/21/living-in-a-browser";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:1;s:8:"xml_lang";s:2:"en";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:9:"

<blockquote cite="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0182.html">
<p>I&#8217;d like to propose a new, optional HTML tag:</p>
<p>IMG</p>
<p>Required argument is <code>SRC="url"</code>. </p>
<p>This names a bitmap or pixmap file for the browser to attempt to pull over the network and interpret as an image, to be embedded in the text at the point of the tag&#8217;s occurrence.</p>
<p>An example is:
<p><code>&lt;IMG SRC="file://foobar.com/foo/bar/blargh.xbm"></code></p>
<p>(There is no closing tag; this is just a standalone tag.)</p>
<p>This tag can be embedded in an anchor like anything else; when that happens, it becomes an icon that&#8217;s sensitive to activation just like a regular text anchor.</p>
<p>Browsers should be afforded flexibility as to which image formats they support. Xbm and Xpm are good ones to support, for example. If a browser cannot interpret a given format, it can do whatever it wants instead (X Mosaic will pop up a default bitmap as a placeholder).</p>
<p>This is required functionality for X Mosaic; we have this working, and we&#8217;ll at least be using it internally. I&#8217;m certainly open to suggestions as to how this should be handled within HTML; if you have a better idea than what I&#8217;m presenting now, please let me know. I know this is hazy wrt image format, but I don&#8217;t see an alternative than to just say &#8220;let the browser do what it can&#8221; and wait for the perfect solution to come along (MIME, someday, maybe).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_BitMap">Xbm</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_PixMap">Xpm</a> were popular graphics formats on Unix systems.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mosaic&#8221; was one of the earliest web browsers. (&#8220;X Mosaic&#8221; was the version that ran on Unix systems.) When he wrote this message in early 1993, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen">Marc Andreessen</a> had not yet founded the company that made him famous, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_Communications_Corporation">Mosaic Communications Corporation</a>, nor had he started work on that company&#8217;s flagship product, &#8220;Mosaic Netscape.&#8221; (You may know them better by their later names, &#8220;Netscape Corporation&#8221; and &#8220;Netscape Navigator.&#8221;)</p>

<p>&#8220;MIME, someday, maybe&#8221; is a reference to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation">content negotiation</a>, a feature of HTTP where a client (like a web browser) tells the server (like a web server) what types of resources it supports (like <code>image/jpeg</code>) so the server can return something in the client&#8217;s preferred format. <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html">The Original HTTP as defined in 1991</a> (the only version that was implemented in February 1993) did not have a way for clients to tell servers what kind of images they supported, thus the design dilemma that Marc faced.</p>

<p>A few hours later, <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0183.html"><cite>Tony Johnson</cite> replied</a>:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0183.html">
<p>I have something very similar in Midas 2.0 (in use here at SLAC, and due for public release any week now), except that all the names are different, and it has an extra argument <code>NAME="name"</code>. It has almost exactly the same functionality as your proposed <code>IMG</code> tag. e.g.</p>
<p><code>&lt;ICON name="NoEntry" href="http://note/foo/bar/NoEntry.xbm"></code></p>
<p>The idea of the name parameter was to allow the browser to have a set of &#8220;built in&#8221; images. If the name matches a &#8220;built in&#8221; image it would use that instead of having to go out and fetch the image. The name could also act as a hint for &#8220;line mode&#8221; browsers as to what kind of a symbol to put in place of the image.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t much care about the parameter or tag names, but it would be sensible if we used the same things. I don&#8217;t much care for abbreviations, ie why not <code>IMAGE=</code> and <code>SOURCE=</code>. I somewhat prefer <code>ICON</code> since it imlies that the <code>IMAGE</code> should be smallish, but maybe <code>ICON</code> is an overloaded word?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MidasWWW">Midas</a> was another early web browser, a contemporary of X Mosaic. It was cross-platform; it ran on both Unix and VMS. &#8220;SLAC&#8221; refers to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Linear_Accelerator">Stanford Linear Accelerator Center</a> (now the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory). SLAC hosted the first web server in the United States (in fact <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/history/earlyweb/history.shtml">the first web server outside Europe</a>). When <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/history/earlyweb/wizards.shtml#Tony%20Johnson">Tony</a> wrote this message, SLAC was an old-timer on the WWW, having hosted <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/history/earlyweb/firstpages.shtml">five pages</a> on their web server for a whopping 441 days.</p>

<p>Tony continued:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While we are on the subject of new tags, I have another, somewhat similar tag, which I would like to support in Midas 2.0. In principle it is:</p>
<p><code>&lt;INCLUDE HREF="..."></code></p>
<p>The intention here would be that the second document is to be included into the first document at the place where the tag occured. In principle the referenced document could be anything, but the main purpose was to allow images (in this case arbitrary sized) to be embedded into documents. Again the intention would be that when HTTP2 comes along the format of the included document would be up for separate negotiation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8220;HTTP2&#8221; is a reference to <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTTP2.html">Basic HTTP as defined in 1992</a>. At this point in early 1993, it was still largely unimplemented. The draft known as &#8220;HTTP2&#8221; evolved and was eventually standardized as &#8220;HTTP 1.0&#8221; (albeit <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.0/spec.html">not for another three years</a>). HTTP 1.0 did include <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTRQ_Headers.html#z3">request headers for content negotiation</a>, a.k.a. &#8220;MIME, someday, maybe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tony continued:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An alternative I was considering was:</p>
<p><code>&lt;A HREF="..." INCLUDE>See photo&lt;/A></code></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t much like adding more functionality to the <code>&lt;A></code> tag, but the idea here is to maintain compatibility with browsers that can not honour the <code>INCLUDE</code> parameter. The intention is that browsers which do understand <code>INCLUDE</code>, replace the anchor text (in this case &#8220;See photo&#8221;) with the included document (picture), while older or dumber browsers ignore the <code>INCLUDE</code> tag completely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This proposal was never implemented, although the idea of text-if-an-image-is-missing is <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/day_23_providing_text_equivalents_for_images.html">an important accessibility technique</a> which was missing from Marc&#8217;s initial <code>&lt;IMG></code> proposal. Many years later, this feature was bolted on as the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/objects.html#h-13.8"><code>&lt;img alt></code> attribute</a>, which Netscape promptly broke by <a href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/html/alt.html#tooltip">erroneously treating it as a tooltip</a>.</p>

<p>A few hours after that, <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0186.html"><cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite> responded</a>:</p>

<pre>EMBED	 Embed this here when presenting it
PRESENT	 Present this whenever the source document is presented</pre>
<p>Note that you can have various combinations of these, and if the browser doesn&#8217;t support either one, it doesn&#8217;t break.</p>

<p>But I am completely willing to live with the requirement that I specify the content type by file extension.</p>

<p>This proposal was never implemented, but Netscape did later add arbitrary embedding of media objects with the <code>&lt;embed></code> element.</p>

<p>Otherwise, next week someone is going to suggest &#8216;lets put in a new tag <code>&lt;AUD SRC="file://foobar.com/foo/bar/blargh.snd"></code>&#8216; for audio.</p>
<p>There shouldn&#8217;t be much cost in going with something that generalizes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the benefit of hindsight, it appears that Jay&#8217;s concerns were well-founded. It took a little more than a week, but HTML5 did finally add new <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#video"><code>&lt;video></code></a> and <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#audio"><code>&lt;audio></code></a> elements.</p>

<p>Responding to Jay&#8217;s original message, <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0204.html"><cite>Dave Raggett</cite> said</a>:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0204.html">
<p>True indeed! I want to consider a whole range of possible image/line art types, along with the possibility of format negotiation. Tim&#8217;s note on supporting clickable areas within images is also important.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later in 1993, <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/">Dave Raggett</a> proposed <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/HTMLPlus/htmlplus_1.html">HTML+</a> as an evolution of the HTML standard. The proposal was never implemented, and it was superceded by <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_toc.html">HTML 2.0</a>. HTML 2.0 was a &#8220;retro-spec,&#8221; which means it formalized features already in common use. &#8220;<a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_1.html#SEC1.1">This specification brings together, clarifies, and formalizes a set of features</a> that roughly corresponds to the capabilities of HTML in common use prior to June 1994.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dave later wrote <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html3/CoverPage.html">HTML 3.0</a>, based on his earlier HTML+ draft. HTML 3.0 was also never implemented (outside of the W3C&#8217;s own reference implementation, <a href="http://www.w3.org/Arena/">Arena</a>), and it was superceded by <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Wilbur/">HTML 3.2</a>. HTML 3.2 was also a &#8220;retro-spec&#8221; &mdash; &#8220;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32.html#intro">HTML 3.2 adds widely deployed features</a> such as tables, applets and text flow around images, while providing full backwards compatibility with the existing standard HTML 2.0.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dave later co-authored <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4">HTML 4.0</a> and developed <a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">HTML Tidy</a>, and went on to help with XHTML, XForms, MathML, and other modern W3C specifications.</p>

<p>Getting back to 1993, <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0209.html">Marc replied to Dave</a>:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0209.html">
<p>Actually, maybe we should think about a general-purpose procedural graphics language within which we can embed arbitrary hyperlinks attached to icons, images, or text, or anything. Has anyone else seen Intermedia&#8217;s capabilities wrt this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermedia_(hypertext)">Intermedia</a> was a hypertext project from Brown University. It was developed from 1985 to 1991 and ran on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/UX">A/UX</a>, a Unix-like operating system for early Macintosh computers.</p>

<p>The idea of a &#8220;general-purpose procedural graphics language&#8221; did eventually catch on. Modern browsers support both <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">SVG</a> (declarative markup with embedded scripting) and <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html#the-canvas-element"><code>&lt;canvas></code></a> (procedural direct-mode graphics API), although the latter <a href="http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1089635050&amp;count=1">started as a proprietary extension</a> before being &#8220;retro-specced&#8221; by the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/">WHATWG</a>.</p>

<p>Other systems to look at which have this (fairly valuable) notion are Andrew and Slate. Andrew is built with _insets_, each of which has some interesting type, such as text, bitmap, drawing, animation, message, spreadsheet, etc. The notion of arbitrary recursive embedding is present, so that an inset of any kind can be embedded in any other kind which supports embedding. For example, an inset can be embedded at any point in the text of the text widget, or in any rectangular area in the drawing widget, or in any cell of the spreadsheet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Andrew&#8221; is a reference to the <a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~AUIS/">Andrew User Interface System</a> (although at that time it was simply known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Project">Andrew Project</a>).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0215.html"><cite>Thomas Fine</cite> had a different idea</a>:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0215.html">
<p>Here&#8217;s my opinion. The best way to do images in WWW is by using MIME. I&#8217;m sure postscript is already a supported subtype in MIME, and it deals very nicely with mixing text and graphics.</p>
<p>But it isn&#8217;t clickable, you say? Yes your right. I suspect there is already an answer to this in display postscript. Even if there isn&#8217;t the addition to standard postscript is trivial. Define an anchor command which specifies the URL and uses the current path as a closed region for the button. Since postscript deals so well with paths, this makes arbitrary button shapes trivial.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_PostScript">Display Postscript</a> was an on-screen rendering technology co-developed by Adobe and NeXT.</p>

<p>This proposal was never implemented, but the idea that the best way to fix HTML is to replace it with something else altogether <a href="http://dbaron.org/log/20090707-ex-html">still pops up from time to time</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q1/0221.html"><cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>, March 2, 1993</a>:</p>

<p>HTTP2 allows a document to contain any type which the user has said he can handle, not just registered MIME types. So one can experiment. Yes I think there is a case for postscript with hypertext. I don&#8217;t know whether display postcript has enough. I know Adobe are trying to establish their own postscript-based &#8220;PDF&#8221; which will have links, and be readable by their proprietory brand of viewers.</p>
<p>I thought that a generic overlaying language for anchors (Hytime based?) would allow the hypertext and the graphics/video standards to evolve separately, which would help both.</p>
<p>Let the <code>IMG</code> tag be <code>INCLUDE</code> and let it refer to an arbitrary document type. Or <code>EMBED</code> if <code>INCLUDE</code> sounds like a cpp include which people will expect to provide SGML source code to be parsed inline &#8212; not what was intended.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.hytime.org/">HyTime</a> was an early, SGML-based hypertext document system. It loomed large in many early discussions of HTML, and later XML.</p>

<p>Tim&#8217;s proposal for an <code>&lt;INCLUDE></code> tag was never implemented, although you can see echoes of it in <code>&lt;object></code>, <code>&lt;embed></code>, and the <code>&lt;iframe></code> element.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re not prepared to support <code>INCLUDE</code>/<code>EMBED</code> at this point. &#8230; So we&#8217;re probably going to go with <code>&lt;IMG SRC="url"></code> (not <code>ICON</code>, since not all inlined images can be meaningfully called icons). For the time being, inlined images won&#8217;t be explicitly content-type&#8217;d; down the road, we plan to support that (along with the general adaptation of MIME). Actually, the image reading routines we&#8217;re currently using figure out the image format on the fly, so the filename extension won&#8217;t even be significant.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t really know why I wrote this. It wasn&#8217;t what I set out to write. That happens. But I am extraordinarily fascinated with all aspects of this almost-17-year-old conversation. Consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>HTTP still exists. HTTP successfully evolved from 0.9 into 1.0 and later 1.1. <a href="http://www.ietf.org/dyn/wg/charter/httpbis-charter.html">And still it evolves</a>.</li>
<li>HTML still exists. That rudimentary data format &mdash; it didn&#8217;t even support inline images! &mdash; successfully evolved into 2.0, 3.2, 4.0. <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/">And still it, too, evolves</a>. HTML is an unbroken line. A twisted, knotted, snarled line, to be sure. There were plenty of &#8220;dead branches&#8221; in the evolutionary tree, places where standards-minded people got ahead of themselves (and ahead of authors and implementors). But still. Here we are, in 2009, and <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html#Examples">web pages from 1990</a> still render in modern browsers. I just loaded one up on my Android phone, and I didn&#8217;t even get prompted to &#8220;please wait while importing legacy format&#8230;&#8221;</li>
<li>HTML has always been a conversation between browser makers, authors, standards wonks, and other people who just showed up and liked to talk about angle brackets. Most of the successful versions of HTML have been &#8220;retro-specs,&#8221; catching up to the world while simultaneously trying to nudge it in the right direction. Anyone who tells you that HTML should be kept &#8220;pure&#8221; (presumably by ignoring browser makers, or ignoring authors, or both) is simply misinformed. HTML has never been pure, and all attempts to purify it have been spectacular failures, matched only by the attempts to replace it.</li>
<li>None of the browsers from 1993 still exist in any recognizable form. Netscape Navigator was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Mozilla_Application_Suite#Open_sourcing_of_Communicator">abandoned in 1998</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Mozilla_Application_Suite#Rewriting_from_scratch">rewritten from scratch</a> to create the Mozilla Suite, which was then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Mozilla_Firefox">forked to create Firefox</a>. Internet Explorer had its humble &#8220;beginnings&#8221; in &#8220;Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95,&#8221; where it was bundled with some desktop themes and a pinball game. (But of course that browser <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyglass_Mosaic">can be traced back further too</a>.)</li>
<li>Some of the operating systems from 1993 still exist, but none of them are relevant to the modern web. Most people today who &#8220;experience&#8221; the web do so on a PC running Windows 2000 or later, a Mac running Mac OS X, a PC running some flavor of Linux, or a handheld device like an iPhone. In 1993, Windows was at version 3.1 (and competing with OS/2), Macs were running System 7, and Linux was distributed via Usenet. (Want to have some fun? Find a graybeard and whisper &#8220;Trumpet Winsock&#8221; or &#8220;MacPPP.&#8221;)</li>
<li>Some of the same <em>people</em> are still around and still involved in what we now simply call &#8220;web standards.&#8221; That&#8217;s after almost 20 years. And some were involved in predecessors of HTML, going back into the 1980s and before.</li>
<li>Speaking of predecessors&#8230; With the eventual popularity of HTML and the web, it is easy to forget the contemporary formats and systems that informed its design. Andrew? Intermedia? HyTime? And HyTime was not some rinky-dink academic research project; <a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/hytime.html">it was an ISO standard</a>. It was approved for military use. It was Big Business. And you can read about it yourself&#8230; <a href="http://www.sgmlsource.com/history/hthist.htm">on this HTML page, in your web browser</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>But none of this answers the original question: why do we have an <code>&lt;img></code> element? Why not an <code>&lt;icon></code> element? Or an <code>&lt;include></code> element? Why not a hyperlink with an <code>include</code> attribute, or some combination of <code>rel</code> values? Why an <code>&lt;img></code> element? Quite simply, because Marc Andreessen shipped one, and shipping code wins.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not to say that <em>all</em> shipping code wins; after all, Andrew and Intermedia and HyTime shipped code too. Code is necessary but not sufficient for success. And I <em>certainly</em> don&#8217;t mean to say that shipping code before a standard will produce the best solution. Marc&#8217;s <code>&lt;img></code> element didn&#8217;t mandate a common graphics format; it didn&#8217;t define how text flowed around it; it didn&#8217;t support text alternatives or fallback content for older browsers. And 16, almost 17 years later, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-abarth-mime-sniff">we&#8217;re still struggling with content sniffing</a>, and it&#8217;s still <a href="http://code.google.com/p/doctype/wiki/ArticleContentSniffing">a source of crazy security vulnerabilities</a>. And you can trace that all the way back, 17 years, through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">Great Browser Wars</a>, all the way back to February 25, 1993, when Marc Andreessen offhandedly remarked, &#8220;MIME, someday, maybe,&#8221; and then shipped his code anyway.</p>

This apparently caused a small firestorm within Apress, the exact details of which I am not privy to, but which (I am told) became a somewhat larger firestorm after the Apress executives realized they had no legal recourse, and asked my opinion on the matter. You see, the book is published under the GNU Free Documentation License, which explicitly gives anyone and everyone <a title="see Sections 2 and 3" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">the right to publish it themselves</a>. (I was about to write &#8220;gives third parties the right,&#8221; until I realized that there are no third parties because there are no second parties. That&#8217;s kind of the point.)</p>

<p>This didn&#8217;t use to matter, because publishing on paper used to require a serious up-front investment in, well, paper. &#8220;Freedom of the press&#8221; was reserved for those with an actual press, and distribution costs were decidedly non-trivial. Publishing a book commercially just wasn&#8217;t practical for anyone but, well, a book publisher. That&#8217;s no longer the case. Copies can be purchased online, printed on demand, and drop-shipped to the customer &#8212; up-front investment be damned. And that&#8217;s for <em>printed</em> books; e-books are even easier.</p>

<p>Software had this problem first, by virtue of its non-corporeality. How many people are selling Free Software on eBay? We deride these sellers as &#8220;scammers,&#8221; but in truth the only time they run afoul of the law is when they attempt to rebrand your software without acknowledgement, or when they fail to abide by some other intentionally inside-out clause of the license that you chose in the first place (e.g. selling GPL&#8217;d binaries without offering source code).</p>

<p>Still, there&#8217;s a qualitative difference between letting people download your own work from your own site, and watching other people try to profit from it. But it is precisely this difference that strikes at the heart of the Free Software/Free Culture ethos. Part of choosing a Free license for your own work is accepting that people may use it in ways you disapprove of. There are no &#8220;field of use&#8221; restrictions, and there are no &#8220;commercial use&#8221; restrictions either. In fact, those are two of the fundamental tenets of the &#8220;Free&#8221; in Free Software. If &#8220;others profiting from my work&#8221; is something you seek to avoid, then Free Software is not for you. Opt for a Creative Commons &#8220;Non-Commercial&#8221; license, or a &#8220;personal use only&#8221; freeware license, or a traditional End User License Agreement. Free Software doesn&#8217;t have &#8220;end users.&#8221; That&#8217;s kind of the point.</p>

<p>The aforementioned Apress executive told me that he did not understand why I would be willing to work with a publisher but then be happy about their competition. This is what I told him:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I enjoy working with publishers because it makes me a better writer. But I don&#8217;t write for money; I write for love (or passion, or whatever you want to call it). I choose open content licenses because this is the way I want the world to work, and the only way to change the world is to change yourself first.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know where that leaves you as a business. But you&#8217;ve made a good amount of money on the original &#8220;Dive Into Python,&#8221; despite the fact that it&#8217;s been available for free online for 8 years. A German translation of <a href="http://diveintopython3.org/">Dive Into Python 3</a> is being published this quarter by Springer/Germany [a division of Apress' parent company] almost simultaneously with the English edition &#8212; much sooner-to-market than it would have been under a closed development process. (And <a href="http://gpiancastelli.altervista.org/dip3-it/">an Italian translation</a> was just released yesterday. You should snap that one up too before someone else does!) So maybe the problems you perceive are really opportunities in disguise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I am grateful for this anonymous soul who woke up one day and said to herself, &#8220;You know what I should do today? I should try to sell copies of that Free book that Pilgrim wrote.&#8221; Grateful, because it afforded me the opportunity to remind myself why I chose a Free license in the first place. My Zen teacher once told me that, when people try to do you harm, you should thank them for giving you the opportunity to forgive them. In this case it&#8217;s even simpler, because there&#8217;s nothing to forgive, just explain. She&#8217;s redistributing the work that I explicitly made redistributable. She&#8217;s kind of the point.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:2:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}s:36:"http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace";a:1:{s:4:"base";s:53:"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2009/10/19/the-point";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:53:"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2009/10/19/the-point";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:1;s:8:"xml_lang";s:2:"en";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:9:"

<blockquote cite="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/tabular-data.html#table-descriptions">
<p>For tables that consist of more than just a grid of cells with headers in the first row and headers in the first column, and for any table in general where the reader might have difficulty understanding the content, authors should include explanatory information introducing the table. This information is useful for all users, but is especially useful for users who cannot see the table, e.g. users of screen readers.</p>
<p>Such explanatory information should introduce the purpose of the table, outline its basic cell structure, highlight any trends or patterns, and generally teach the user how to use the table.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways to include this information, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>In prose, surrounding the table</li>
<li>In the table&#8217;s caption</li>
<li>In the table&#8217;s caption, in a details element</li>
<li>Next to the table, in the same figure</li>
<li>Next to the table, in a figure&#8217;s legend</li>
</ul>
<p>Authors may also use other techniques, or combinations of the above techniques, as appropriate.</p>
<p>If a table element has a summary attribute, the user agent may report the contents of that attribute to the user.</p>

Simply put, you are messing in somebody else&#8217;s yard, and it is against W3C process to be doing so.

<p>Contradictory information *harms* the overall outreach aspect of teaching people how to create accessible web content, and I speak from the position of one who actually does that for a living, and have been doing so for close to a decade.  THE MESSAGE WE SEND TO THE WORLD&#8217;S WEB DEVELOPERS MUST BE CONSISTENT!</p>

<p>Has that group weighed in in this debate, in response to the evidence presented?  Or is it just that an out-of-date (i.e., not updated in response to newer evidence) recommendation of that group is being cited?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know &#8212; it isn&#8217;t a relevant question.  The group exists [link to <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)</a>] and seems to be open for your input.</p>
